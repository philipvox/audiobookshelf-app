## What Is This?

Secret Library is a mobile client for [AudiobookShelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) — the open-source, self-hosted audiobook server. It connects to your ABS server and plays your books. Your data stays on your server. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party anything.

This was vibe coded. I'm not a professional developer — I built this with AI assistance. But it's not a one-shot prompt. This is build 1,262, iterated over months of daily use. Every feature was planned, tested, broken, and fixed.

It's opinionated. Some things are designed for how I listen, not for mass appeal. If that bothers you, fork it and make it yours.

## The Ecosystem

Secret Library is actually three things:

| Piece | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **[Secret Library](https://mysecretlibrary.com)** (this repo) | Mobile audiobook player for iOS and Android |
| **[Audiobook Tagger](https://mysecretlibrary.com/tagger.html)** | Desktop tool that fixes metadata in bulk — clean genres, find covers, detect series, generate DNA tags |
| **[Secret Spines](https://spines.mysecretlibrary.com)** | Community spine image library — browse, upload, vote on book spine designs |

The app works fine on its own. The Tagger makes your library discoverable. The spines make your shelf look real.

## DNA Tags

The Audiobook Tagger generates rich metadata called DNA tags — mood, pacing, themes, tropes, comparable titles. The app reads these and uses them to power:

- **Browse by vibe** — mood chips like "Dark & Atmospheric" or "Laugh Out Loud"
- **"Because you listened to..."** — recommendations based on what you've finished
- **Discover tab** — genre sections, collections, mood-based filtering
- **Top picks** — personalized suggestions based on your taste profile

Without the Tagger the app works fine as a player. With it, your library becomes something you can explore.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An [AudiobookShelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) server
- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philipvox/SecretLibrary-ABS-Client.git
cd SecretLibrary-ABS-Client
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm start              # Start Expo dev server
npm run ios            # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android        # Run on Android emulator
npx expo run:ios       # Native iOS build
npx expo run:android   # Native Android build
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build:android   # EAS production build (Android)
npm run build:ios       # EAS production build (iOS)
npm run build:all       # Both platforms
npm run build:preview   # Internal testing builds
```

Builds use [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) with three profiles in `eas.json`: `development`, `preview`, and `production`.

Features are self-contained modules. They don't import from each other — shared code goes in `src/shared/`.

## Hidden Interactions

Some things aren't obvious by design:

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|
| Long-press the skull logo | Opens settings |
| Double-tap a book cover | Adds/removes a gold star |
| Swipe left/right on book detail | Browse series |
| Book menu > spine icon | Pick a community spine |
