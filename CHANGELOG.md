## [0.7.101] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Library Loading Flash (Secret Library)

Fixed the library screen flash where books visibly reorder after appearing.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple async operations completed at different times after the splash dismissed:
1. Cache loaded from SQLite → books shown
2. Background author merge triggered state update → books reordered
3. Initial refresh completed → books reordered again

**The Fix:**
1. Added `appReadyStore` - global flag tracking when app boot is fully complete
2. LibraryScreen waits for `isBootComplete` before showing sorted books
3. Initial library refresh moved to App.tsx boot sequence (during splash)
4. Removed background author merge that caused separate state update
5. Splash shows "syncing library..." status during refresh phase

**Technical Changes:**
- Created `src/core/stores/appReadyStore.ts` - Boot completion tracking
- `App.tsx` - Triggers initial refresh during boot, sets boot complete flag
- `LibraryScreen.tsx` - Waits for `isBootComplete` before rendering books
- `libraryCache.ts` - Removed background author fetch (done in full refresh)

**Files Modified:**
- `App.tsx` - Boot sequence with initial refresh
- `src/core/stores/appReadyStore.ts` (NEW) - Boot completion store
- `src/core/cache/libraryCache.ts` - Remove background author merge
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Wait for boot complete
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.100] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Library Loading Flash (Improved)

Improved the loading state detection to also wait for background server sync.

**Issue:**
Even with initial `isDataReady` guard, books still reordered because:
- React Query `isLoading` is false when cached data exists (even if stale)
- Background server sync updates `lastPlayedAt` values, changing sort order

**The Fix:**
- Added `isFetching` from React Query (catches all fetches, not just initial)
- Added `isServerLoading` from `useContinueListening` (server query status)
- `isDataReady` now waits for: libraryCache + downloads + progress + fetching + server sync

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/library/hooks/useLibraryData.ts` - Include isFetching and isServerLoading in isDataReady
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.99] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Library Loading Flash / Book Reordering

Fixed the issue where books visibly reorder/flash when the library screen loads.

**Root Cause:**
Three independent data sources load at different times, each triggering a sort re-run:
1. `progressStore` loads from SQLite → first sort
2. `downloadMap` finishes → sort runs again (books shift)
3. `sqliteProgressMap` completes → sort runs again (more shifting)

**The Fix:**
- Added `isDataReady` guard that waits for ALL data sources before applying sort
- Show skeleton while any data source is loading
- Only render sorted books after all sources complete
- Prevents intermediate states where books appear in wrong order

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/library/hooks/useLibraryData.ts` - Added combined loading state, guarded sort with isDataReady
- `src/features/library/screens/MyLibraryScreen.tsx` - Use new isLoading flag from hook
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.98] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Complete Spine Title Display (Both Views)

Fixed titles being truncated in both shelf and stack views.

**Horizontal/Stack View Fix:**
- Added `isHorizontalDisplay` prop to `BookSpineVertical`
- Force `vertical-up` orientation for horizontal display (skips stacked-words)
- Increased title container width to `height - 40` for more room
- Skip stacked-letters/stacked-words when displaying horizontally

**Vertical/Shelf View Fix (Two-Row Titles):**
- Added `vertical-two-row` handling to `finalTitleOrientation` mapping
- Added fallback: any 4+ word title on vertical spine uses two-row
- Reduced two-row font size from 60% to 45% to fit both lines in narrow spine width
- `TemplateSpineRenderer` now properly renders two-row titles

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Two-row rendering, horizontal display handling
- `src/features/home/components/BookshelfView.tsx` - Pass `isHorizontalDisplay={true}` to StaticStackItem
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.96] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Horizontal Stack View Orientation + Author Line Height

Fixed spine display issues in horizontal/stack mode:

**Issue 1: Title Orientation**
- Problem: Titles used stacked-words orientation which doesn't work when rotated
- Fix: Added `isHorizontalDisplay` prop; forces `vertical-up` orientation for horizontal display

**Issue 2: Stacked Author Names Line Height**
- Problem: Stacked author names (MATT/DINNIMAN) had too much vertical spacing
- Fix: Tightened line height to 0.95x and added negative margin between names

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Added isHorizontalDisplay prop, fixed author line height
- `src/features/home/components/BookshelfView.tsx` - Pass isHorizontalDisplay={true} from StaticStackItem
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.94] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Drop Cap Font Not Loading on Android

Fixed the TypographerWoodcut drop cap font not loading on Android devices.

**Root Cause:**
- Font was registered as `'TypographerWoodcut'` but internal TTF name is `'TypographerWoodcutInitialsOne'`
- On Android, React Native requires the registered font name to match the internal font name exactly
- Font was also in optional "genre-specific" block with silent error handling

**The Fix:**
- Changed font registration to use correct internal name: `'TypographerWoodcutInitialsOne'`
- Moved font to core fonts block (always required, errors visible)
- Updated usage in SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Fixed font name and moved to core block
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Updated fontFamily
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.93] - 2026-01-16

### Feature: "All Authors/Narrators/Series" Navigation Pills (#12)

Added navigation pills to detail screens for quick access to full list screens.

**Changes:**
- AuthorDetailScreen: Added "All Authors" pill → navigates to AuthorsListScreen
- NarratorDetailScreen: Updated "Narrator" pill to "All Narrators" with navigation
- SeriesDetailScreen: Updated "Series" pill to "All Series" with navigation to SeriesListScreen

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/author/screens/SecretLibraryAuthorDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/features/narrator/screens/SecretLibraryNarratorDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/features/series/screens/SecretLibrarySeriesDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.88] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Stacked Authors Now Actually Works

Fixed the stacked author override not being applied. The previous fix (v0.7.86-0.7.87) modified `composition.author.orientation`, but the actual rendering uses `templateConfig` which was passed directly to `TemplateSpineRenderer`.

**Root Cause:**
- Two separate config objects: `templateConfig` (used for rendering) and `composition` (not used by template path)
- The override was applied to `composition`, but `TemplateSpineRenderer` reads from `templateConfig`

**The Fix:**
- Now creates a derived `templateConfig` with the stacked-words override baked in
- Override applies directly to what `TemplateSpineRenderer` actually uses
- Stacking applied for all books under 30 hours with multi-word author names

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Moved override from composition to templateConfig
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.87] - 2026-01-16

### Enhancement: Stacked Authors for All Books (Except 30+ Hours)

Changed the stacking threshold from width-based to duration-based. Now ALL books under 30 hours get stacked author names by default.

**Before (v0.7.86):**
- Only books with width > 60px (~10+ hours) got stacked author names
- Short books (under 10 hours) showed horizontal author names

**After (v0.7.87):**
- ALL books under 30 hours get stacked author names (default)
- Books 30+ hours skip stacking for readability on very wide spines
- Change is based on duration, not width, for more predictable behavior

**Example:**
- 2-hour book "The Name of the Wind" now shows:
  ```
  PATRICK
  ROTHFUSS
  ```
- 45-hour epic audiobook keeps its genre-determined orientation

**Technical:**
- Threshold: `30 * 3600 = 108,000 seconds` (30 hours)
- Condition changed from `width > 60` to `duration < LONG_BOOK_THRESHOLD_SECONDS`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.86] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Author Stacking Now Works (Aligned with Template Preview)

Fixed author stacking not working on medium/large spines. The fix aligns with how the Spine Template Preview page implements stacked authors.

**Root Cause:**
- BookSpineVertical used a separate `authorSplitNames` boolean
- Template preview uses `orientation === 'stacked-words'` in the composition
- The two approaches weren't aligned

**The Fix:**
1. **Composition override**: When conditions are met (width > 60px, multi-word author, not explicitly horizontal), set `composition.author.orientation = 'stacked-words'`
2. **Render condition**: Updated to check BOTH `authorSplitNames` OR `composition?.author?.orientation === 'stacked-words'`

**Result:**
- Fantasy books like "Kings of the Wyld" by Nicholas Eames now display as:
  ```
  NICHOLAS
  EAMES
  ```
- Stacking respects genre settings - genres with `authorOrientationBias: 'horizontal'` keep horizontal names

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.85] - 2026-01-16

### Debug: Author Stacking Investigation (superseded by 0.7.86)

Added diagnostic logging for author stacking investigation. This was superseded by the fix in 0.7.86.

---

## [0.7.84] - 2026-01-16

### Enhancement: Default Stacked Authors on Medium/Large Spines

Changed the default behavior for author name display on medium and large book spines.

**Before:**
- Only Fantasy+Humor genres got stacked author names (e.g., "BRANDON / SANDERSON")
- Other genres showed single-line horizontal author names

**After:**
- ALL medium/large spines (width > 60px, ~10+ hour books) default to stacked author names
- EXCEPTION: Genres with explicit `authorOrientationBias: 'horizontal'` in their profile keep horizontal names
- This creates a more editorial, dramatic look across all longer audiobooks

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Stack author names if:
// 1. Spine is medium/large (width > 60px)
// 2. Author has multiple words
// 3. Genre doesn't explicitly request horizontal orientation
const authorSplitNames = isMediumOrLargeSpine &&
  authorHasMultipleNames &&
  !isExplicitlyHorizontal;
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.83] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Animated Splash Lag on Section Changes

Fixed animation jank/lag when the loading status text changes during app initialization.

**Root Cause:**
- When `progress` or `statusText` props changed, the entire `AnimatedSplash` re-rendered
- This caused the `SkullCandle` component to re-render mid-animation
- The flame animation uses `setState` at 12fps, creating a cascade of re-renders

**The Fix:**
- Wrapped `SkullCandle` in `React.memo()` to prevent re-renders from parent prop changes
- Replaced `useState` with `useReducer` for frame animation (slightly more efficient for frequent updates)
- The candle flame now animates independently of parent state changes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/components/AnimatedSplash.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.82] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Library Loading Flash (#4)

Fixed the library screen flash where books would render with default dimensions, then re-render with correct spine dimensions.

**Root Cause:**
- Spine cache was populated AFTER library items loaded, causing a second render
- First render: Books shown with fallback dimensions
- Spine cache populates → Second render: Books shown with correct dimensions

**The Fix:**
Pre-hydrate spine cache from SQLite BEFORE library items are displayed:
1. Added `hydrateFromSQLite(libraryId)` method to `spineCache.ts`
2. Called this in `prefetchService.hydrateFromCache()` before loading library items
3. Spine dimensions are now ready BEFORE first render → no flash

**Technical Flow (Before):**
```
1. prefetchService loads library items
2. UI renders (empty spine cache → fallback dimensions)
3. libraryCache populates spine cache
4. UI re-renders (correct dimensions) ← FLASH
```

**Technical Flow (After):**
```
1. prefetchService hydrates spine cache from SQLite
2. prefetchService loads library items
3. UI renders (spine cache ready → correct dimensions) ← NO FLASH
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/stores/spineCache.ts` - Added `hydrateFromSQLite()` method
- `src/core/services/prefetchService.ts` - Call spine hydration before loading items
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.81] - 2026-01-16

### Fix: Drop Cap Line Height Alignment

Fixed the text beside the drop cap not aligning properly with the box height.

**The Math:**
- Drop cap box: 60×60px (square)
- Lines beside drop cap: 3
- Required line height: 60px ÷ 3 = 20px per line

**Changes:**
- Updated DROP_CAP_CONFIG to match 60px box size
- Fixed dropCapText lineHeight from 22px → 20px
- Now 3 lines of text exactly fill the drop cap height
- Gap between drop cap and text: 10px

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.80] - 2026-01-16

### Enhancement: Square Drop Cap Container

Made the drop cap container a perfect square for better visual balance.

**Changes:**
- Drop cap box is now square (height = width)
- Letter is centered both horizontally and vertically within the square
- Renamed `boxWidth` to `boxSize` in config for clarity
- Font sized to fill the square without overflow

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.79] - 2026-01-16

### Enhancement: Decorative Woodcut Drop Cap

Updated the drop cap (large initial letter) in book descriptions to use an ornate woodcut initials font for a vintage literary aesthetic.

**Visual Changes:**
- Drop cap now uses TypographerWoodcut font (decorative medieval-style woodcut initials)
- Larger sizing (80px) to fill the space properly with ornate detail
- Increased box width from 56px to 70px for better proportion
- Creates a classic book/manuscript feel befitting the "Secret Library" theme

**Technical Details:**
- Added `TypographerWoodcut01.ttf` font to assets and font loader
- Updated DROP_CAP_CONFIG with larger dimensions
- Font loaded during app initialization with other genre-specific fonts

**Files Modified:**
- `src/assets/fonts/TypographerWoodcut01.ttf` (new file)
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Added woodcut font to loader
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Updated drop cap styling
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.78] - 2026-01-16

### Enhancement: Spine System Improvements

Multiple enhancements to the book spine visualization system for better visual differentiation and readability.

**Fantasy+Humor Author Stacking (#14):**
- Fantasy and Humor genre books now stack author names vertically on medium/large spines
- Creates an editorial book cover look (e.g., "BRANDON / SANDERSON")
- Only applies to spines wider than 60px (roughly 10+ hour audiobooks)
- Authors with multi-word names get the stacked treatment

**Better Duration→Width Curve (#18):**
- Changed from linear to ease-out quadratic curve
- Provides better visual differentiation in the 1-15 hour range (most common audiobooks)
- Gradual flattening for longer books prevents oversized spines
- Example: 5hr book now 89px (was 68px), 10hr now 129px (was 91px)

**Children's Book Fonts (#19):**
- Prioritized readable fonts over quirky decorative ones
- Primary font changed from Barriecito (handwriting) to Oswald-Bold (clean sans-serif)
- Font fallback order: Oswald-Bold → BebasNeue-Regular → Notable-Regular → Barriecito
- Expanded genre matching to include "children's", "picture book", "early readers", "chapter books"

**Book Details Polish:**
- Changed "Year" label to "Published" for clarity

**Top Nav Labeled Pills:**

## [0.7.71] - 2026-01-15

### Performance: SQLite Spine Cache & Pre-sorted Genre Books

**Major Performance Improvements:**

1. **SQLite Spine Cache Persistence**
   - Pre-computed spine data now persisted to SQLite
   - On subsequent app launches, spine data loads instantly from SQLite
   - Only new/changed books need recalculation
   - Eliminates expensive typography/dimension calculations on every startup

2. **Pre-sorted Genre Books**
   - Books within genres are now sorted by title during cache build
   - Genre pages no longer need to sort on every navigation
   - Moves O(n log n) sort from "per visit" to "once on cache load"

**Technical Changes:**

- Added `spine_cache` table to SQLite schema
- Added `getSpineCache()`, `setSpineCache()`, `clearSpineCache()` methods
- `populateFromLibrary()` now async: loads from SQLite first, computes missing, saves back
- `buildIndexes()` now pre-sorts genre books by title

**Performance Impact:**
- First app launch: Same as before (computes + saves to SQLite)
- Subsequent launches: Spine cache loads from SQLite (instant vs 500-1500ms compute)
- Genre page navigation: O(1) access to pre-sorted books vs O(n log n) sort

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - Added spine_cache table and methods
- `src/features/home/stores/spineCache.ts` - SQLite persistence, async populate
- `src/core/cache/libraryCache.ts` - Pre-sort genre books, pass libraryId to spineCache
- `src/features/library/screens/GenreDetailScreen.tsx` - Use pre-sorted books directly
- `src/constants/version.ts`

### Performance: Lazy Tab Calculations & Pre-computed Duration

**Problem:** Genre pages still had noticeable lag when opening due to expensive useMemo calculations running on initial mount.

**Optimizations:**

1. **Lazy Tab Calculations** - Tab-specific data only computed when that tab is active:
   - `authorList` - Only computed when Author tab selected
   - `seriesList` - Only computed when Series tab selected
   - `narratorList` - Only computed when Narrator tab selected
   - `allBooksBySeries` - Only computed when All tab + Shelf view active
   - Each returns empty array `[]` immediately if not needed, skipping iteration

2. **Pre-computed Total Duration** - Added `totalDuration` to genre index:
   - New `totalDuration: number` field in `GenreInfo` interface
   - Duration accumulated during `buildIndexes()` (runs once on cache load)
   - Genre pages now read pre-computed value instead of reducing through all books

**Performance Impact:**
- Initial render calculates only: genre lookup O(1), books sort O(n log n), nothing else
- Tab switching triggers lazy computation only for that specific tab
- Total duration: O(n) → O(1) lookup from pre-computed index

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/cache/libraryCache.ts` - Added `totalDuration` to GenreInfo, pre-compute during indexing
- `src/features/library/screens/GenreDetailScreen.tsx` - Lazy tab calculations, use pre-computed duration
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.69] - 2026-01-15

### Feature: Genre Tab on Series Detail Page

Added a Genre tab to the Series detail screen to view books grouped by genre.

**Changes:**
- Added `'genre'` to `FilterTab` type
- Added `genreList` useMemo to group books by genre
- Added `handleGenrePress` callback for navigation to genre pages
- Added Genre tab button in tabs row
- Added content sections for genre tab (both Series and Book view modes)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/series/screens/SecretLibrarySeriesDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.68] - 2026-01-15

### Performance: Genre Page Loading Speed

**Problem:** Genre pages loaded significantly slower than Author/Narrator pages.

**Root Causes Found:**
1. **No pre-built genre index** - Author/Narrator pages used `getAuthor()`/`getNarrator()` which returned pre-indexed Map data instantly. Genre pages used `filterItems({ genres: [name] })` which looped through the ENTIRE library.
2. **Hook called inside useCallback** - `ShelfView` component was defined inline using `useCallback` but called `useBookRowLayout()` hook inside, violating React's Rules of Hooks.

**Fixes:**
1. **Added genre index to library cache:**
   - New `genresWithBooks: Map<string, GenreInfo>` storing books per genre
   - New `getGenre(name)` method for instant O(1) lookup
   - Books indexed by genre during `buildIndexes()` (same as authors/narrators)

2. **Extracted ShelfView to proper component:**
   - Moved from inline `useCallback` to standalone function component
   - Hooks now called at top level (proper React pattern)
   - Uses `useMemo` for spine data transformation

**Performance Impact:**
- Genre lookup: O(n) → O(1) where n = library size
- Eliminates full library scan on every genre page visit
- Proper hook lifecycle for ShelfView rendering

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/cache/libraryCache.ts` - Added genre index and `getGenre()` method
- `src/features/library/screens/GenreDetailScreen.tsx` - Use `getGenre()`, extract ShelfView component
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.67] - 2026-01-15

### Feature: Genre Detail Page Redesign (Secret Library Style)

**Complete redesign of GenreDetailScreen to match Author/Narrator detail pages:**

**Visual Changes:**
- Dark header with large Playfair Display genre title + book count/duration stats
- White content area (adapts to dark mode) with JetBrains Mono metadata
- Removed old search bar and sort dropdown
- Added "GENRE" pill in TopNav that links to GenresList

**New Features:**
1. **Filter Tabs** - All | Author | Series | Narrator
   - "All" groups books by series (with Standalone section)
   - Other tabs group by that entity with clickable headers

2. **View Toggle** - Switch between "Book" and "Shelf" views
   - Book view: Vertical list with cover thumbnails, title, author, series info, duration
   - Shelf view: Horizontal scroll with BookSpineVertical components

3. **Tappable Group Headers** - All group headers (author names, series names, narrator names) navigate to their respective detail pages

4. **Footer Stats** - Shows total titles and hours

**Technical:**
- Uses `useSecretLibraryColors()` for dark/light mode support
- Uses `BookSpineVertical` + `useBookRowLayout` for shelf visualization
- Uses `useSpineCacheStore` for cached spine colors
- Maintains pull-to-refresh with `SkullRefreshControl`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/library/screens/GenreDetailScreen.tsx` - Complete rewrite
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.66] - 2026-01-15

### Feature: Tappable Genre Headers and Navigation Pills

**Added navigation to detail screens:**

1. **Genre Headers** - Genre group headers (e.g., "Fantasy", "Thriller") in Author/Narrator detail screens are now tappable and navigate to the Genre Detail page

2. **NARRATOR Pill** - The NARRATOR pill in the top navigation of the Narrator Detail screen now navigates to the full Narrators List

**Implementation:**
- Added `handleGenrePress` callback to `SecretLibraryNarratorDetailScreen.tsx` and `SecretLibraryAuthorDetailScreen.tsx`
- Wrapped genre header `<Text>` components in `<Pressable>` for tap handling
- Added `onPress` to NARRATOR pill to navigate to `NarratorsList`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/narrator/screens/SecretLibraryNarratorDetailScreen.tsx` - Genre headers + NARRATOR pill navigation
- `src/features/author/screens/SecretLibraryAuthorDetailScreen.tsx` - Genre headers navigation
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.65] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Library Loading Flash/Reflow

**Problem:** Home screen would flash or reflow when loading, showing empty state briefly before content appeared.

**Root Cause:** The library sync effect in `useHomeData` was calling `setLibraryBooks` twice:
1. First with cached books immediately (partial data)
2. Second after fetching missing books (complete data)

This double state update caused two renders, resulting in visible layout shift.

**Fix:** Batch the state updates into a single call:
- If all books are cached: single immediate update ✓
- If some books need fetching: wait for all data, then single update ✓

```typescript
// BEFORE: Two state updates (flash)
setLibraryBooks(cachedBooks);     // First render (partial)
await fetchMissing();
setLibraryBooks(allBooks);         // Second render (complete) → FLASH

// AFTER: Single state update (no flash)
if (allCached) {
  setLibraryBooks(cachedBooks);    // Single render (complete)
} else {
  await fetchMissing();
  setLibraryBooks(allBooks);       // Single render (complete)
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/hooks/useHomeData.ts` - Batched state updates in library sync effect
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.64] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Series Spine Height Consistency

**Problem:** Books in the same series had different spine heights on the home screen shelf, making series look inconsistent.

**Root Cause:** The new spine system's `calculateHeight()` function used `seriesName` directly as the hash key without normalizing it. Series names like "The Expanse #1" and "The Expanse #2" would hash to different values, resulting in different heights.

**Fix:** Added `normalizeSeriesName()` function that strips sequence numbers and normalizes the series name before hashing:

```typescript
// BEFORE: "The Expanse #1" and "The Expanse #2" → different hashes → different heights
const hashKey = seriesName || bookId || 'default';

// AFTER: Both normalize to "expanse" → same hash → same height
const hashKey = seriesName ? normalizeSeriesName(seriesName) : (bookId || 'default');
```

The normalization:
- Removes trailing `#N` or `#N.N` (e.g., "#7", "#3.5")
- Removes leading articles ("the", "a", "an")
- Normalizes apostrophes and whitespace
- Converts to lowercase

This matches the existing normalization in the old spine system's `getSeriesStyle()` function.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/core/dimensions.ts` - Added normalizeSeriesName(), updated calculateHeight()
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.63] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Complete Download Pause Solution

**Problem:** Paused downloads kept restarting despite multiple fix attempts.

**Root Cause #3:** The `updateDownloadProgress` function in sqliteCache **unconditionally** sets `status = 'downloading'` on every progress update. Even after we set status to 'paused', in-flight progress callbacks would overwrite it back to 'downloading'.

**Fix:** Modified SQL to preserve 'paused' status:
```sql
-- BEFORE: Always overwrites status
UPDATE downloads SET progress = ?, status = 'downloading' WHERE item_id = ?

-- AFTER: Preserves 'paused' status
UPDATE downloads SET progress = ?,
  status = CASE WHEN status = 'paused' THEN 'paused' ELSE 'downloading' END
WHERE item_id = ?
```

**Complete Fix Summary (v0.7.59-0.7.63):**
1. **v0.7.59**: Fixed `pauseDownload` to always update DB (not just when active download exists)
2. **v0.7.60**: Added `userPaused` flag to prevent auto-resume on app restart
3. **v0.7.61**: Added pause detection in retry loop to break out when paused
4. **v0.7.62**: Reordered pause logic (update DB BEFORE `pauseAsync`) + preserve in-memory progress
5. **v0.7.63**: Fixed `updateDownloadProgress` to not overwrite 'paused' status

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - updateDownloadProgress preserves 'paused' status
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.62] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Download Pause Race Condition + Progress Preservation

**Problem 1:** Paused downloads would immediately restart. User taps pause → shows paused briefly → restarts downloading.

**Root Cause:** Race condition between pause and retry loop:
1. User taps pause → `pauseDownload()` starts
2. `pauseAsync()` causes `downloadAsync()` to return `null`
3. Retry loop checks DB status BEFORE `pauseDownload()` finishes updating DB
4. Retry loop sees `status: 'downloading'` → retries immediately
5. New download starts before pause completes

**Fix:** Update DB status to 'paused' BEFORE calling `pauseAsync()`:
```typescript
// BEFORE: pauseAsync() first, then update DB (race condition)
await download.pauseAsync();
await sqliteCache.setDownload({ status: 'paused', ... });

// AFTER: Update DB first, then pauseAsync() (no race)
await sqliteCache.setDownload({ status: 'paused', ... });
await download.pauseAsync();  // Now retry loop sees 'paused' status
```

**Problem 2:** Progress showing 0% after pause because we read stale DB progress.

**Fix:** Use in-memory progress (most current) if available:
```typescript
const memoryProgress = this.progressInfo.get(itemId);
if (memoryProgress && memoryProgress.totalBytes > 0) {
  currentProgress = Math.max(dbProgress, memoryProgress.bytesDownloaded / memoryProgress.totalBytes);
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/downloadManager.ts` - Reordered pause logic, use memory progress, preserve existing record fields
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.61] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Paused Downloads No Longer Restart via Retry Loop

**Problem:** Even after the v0.7.60 fix, paused downloads would immediately restart. The download would show "Paused" briefly then continue downloading.

**Root Cause:** When `pauseAsync()` is called on a `FileSystem.DownloadResumable`, the `downloadAsync()` promise resolves to `null`. The download retry logic interpreted this `null` as a failed download and automatically retried:

```
LOG: Pausing download: b6e273...
LOG: Paused active download object for: b6e273...
WARN: Attempt 1 failed: Download returned null  ← null = paused, not failed!
LOG: Retry attempt 2/3 for file 1...            ← Oops, retrying!
```

**Solution:** Before retrying after a `null` result, check if the download status is 'paused':

1. In `downloadFileWithRetry()`: After `downloadAsync()` returns `null`, query the database status
2. If status is 'paused', throw a special `DOWNLOAD_PAUSED` error instead of retrying
3. In `startDownload()` catch block: Handle `DOWNLOAD_PAUSED` gracefully - don't mark as failed

```typescript
if (!result) {
  // Check if download was paused - don't treat as error
  const status = await sqliteCache.getDownload(itemId);
  if (status?.status === 'paused') {
    throw new Error('DOWNLOAD_PAUSED'); // Break retry loop
  }
  throw new Error('Download returned null');
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/downloadManager.ts` - Added pause detection in retry loop, graceful handling in catch block
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.60] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: User-Paused Downloads No Longer Auto-Resume

**Problem:** User reported "it says paused then starts again" - when the user explicitly paused a download, it would restart automatically.

**Root Cause:** The `resumePausedDownloads()` function in `downloadManager.ts` runs during app initialization and automatically resumes ALL downloads with 'paused' status. This didn't distinguish between:
- **User-initiated pause**: User explicitly tapped pause → should STAY paused
- **System-initiated pause**: App killed, network lost → can auto-resume

**Solution:** Added a `userPaused` boolean flag to track whether the pause was user-initiated:

1. **Database Schema**: Added `user_paused` column to downloads table (INTEGER, defaults to 0)
2. **DownloadRecord Interface**: Added `userPaused: boolean` field
3. **pauseDownload()**: Sets `userPaused: true` when user explicitly pauses
4. **resumeDownload()**: Clears `userPaused` to false when user resumes
5. **resumePausedDownloads()**: Only auto-resumes downloads where `userPaused === false`

```typescript
// resumePausedDownloads now filters user-paused downloads
const paused = await sqliteCache.getDownloadsByStatus('paused');
const systemPaused = paused.filter((d) => !d.userPaused);  // Can auto-resume
const userPaused = paused.filter((d) => d.userPaused);     // Must stay paused

if (userPaused.length > 0) {
  log(`Skipping ${userPaused.length} user-paused downloads`);
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - Added userPaused field to DownloadRecord, migration, getter/setter updates
- `src/core/services/downloadManager.ts` - pauseDownload sets userPaused=true, resumeDownload clears it, resumePausedDownloads filters
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.59] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Download Pause Now Works Reliably

**Problem:** Tapping "pause" on a downloading book did nothing - the download continued and the UI didn't update.

**Root Cause:** The `pauseDownload` function in `downloadManager.ts` only updated the database status if there was an active `FileSystem.DownloadResumable` object in memory. This object could be missing if:
- The app was restarted while a download was in progress
- There was a timing issue between queueing and starting the download
- The download was pending but not yet actively downloading

When no active download object existed, the function logged a warning but silently did nothing, leaving the status unchanged.

**Fix:** Changed `pauseDownload` to always update the database status to 'paused' for any download that's in 'downloading' or 'pending' state, regardless of whether there's an active download object:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Only updated DB if active download object existed
if (download) {
  await download.pauseAsync();
  await sqliteCache.setDownload({ status: 'paused', ... });
} else {
  logWarn('No active download found'); // Silent failure
}

// AFTER: Always update DB for in-progress downloads
if (download) {
  await download.pauseAsync();
}
// Always update database if download is in progress
const existing = await sqliteCache.getDownload(itemId);
if (existing?.status === 'downloading' || existing?.status === 'pending') {
  await sqliteCache.setDownload({ status: 'paused', ... });
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/downloadManager.ts` - Fixed pauseDownload to always update DB
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.58] - 2026-01-15

### Feature: Download Pause/Resume Controls Everywhere

Added pause/resume functionality for downloads in all major locations:

**Player Screen (`SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx`):**
- Download pill now shows status: "Save", progress %, "Paused", "Queued"
- Tap while downloading to pause
- Tap while paused to resume
- Tap while queued to cancel

**Book Detail Screen (`SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`):**
- Download button now supports pause/resume
- Shows "Tap to pause" during active download
- Shows "Paused - X%" when paused with tap to resume
- Shows "Queued - Tap to cancel" when pending

**Existing Support:**
- `SeriesBookRow.tsx` already had pause/resume (no changes needed)
- `CircularDownloadButton` component already supports all states

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx`
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.57] - 2026-01-15

### UI: Player Logo Navigation and Default Chapter View

**Changes:**

1. **Logo Navigation**: Player logo/skull now navigates to the Secret Library home page (`HomeTab`) instead of the Library tab
2. **Default Chapter View**: Player now opens with the chapters panel visible by default, making it easier to navigate within the book

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx`
  - `handleLogoPress` now navigates to `HomeTab`
  - `activeSheet` defaults to `'chapters'` with animations in open state
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.56] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Per-Book Playback Speed Now Saves Correctly

**Problem:** When changing playback speed on the player screen, the speed wasn't being saved for the correct book. The setting would be lost when returning to the book later.

**Root Cause:** The `setPlaybackRate` function used `currentBook?.id` to determine which book to save the speed for. However, `currentBook` is the book whose audio is currently loaded/playing, which can differ from `viewingBook` (the book shown on the player screen). When viewing a different book, the speed was saved for the wrong book.

**Fix:** Updated `setPlaybackRate` to use `viewingBook` when available, falling back to `currentBook`:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Used currentBook (wrong when viewing different book)
const { currentBook } = get();
await useSpeedStore.getState().setPlaybackRate(rate, currentBook?.id);

// AFTER: Use viewingBook first (the book user is setting speed for)
const { viewingBook, currentBook } = get();
const targetBook = viewingBook || currentBook;
await useSpeedStore.getState().setPlaybackRate(rate, targetBook?.id);
```

**Additional Improvements:**
- Added debug logging to track speed save/load flow
- `getBookSpeed` now logs when returning saved vs default speeds

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Use viewingBook for speed saving
- `src/features/player/stores/speedStore.ts` - Added debug logging
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.55] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Sleep Timer Now Properly Pauses Playback and Shows Real-Time Countdown

**Problem:** Sleep timer would reach 0 but playback wouldn't pause. Additionally, the timer display showed a static value instead of counting down.

**Root Causes:**
1. **State Desynchronization:** The UI read `sleepTimer` from `playerStore`, but only `sleepTimerStore` was updated during countdown. `playerStore.sleepTimer` was set once and never updated again.
2. **Closure Bug in extendSleepTimer:** The countdown interval calculated remaining time from a fixed `endTime` closure variable. When `extendSleepTimer` updated the state, the interval still used the original `endTime`, so extensions didn't actually work.
3. **Missing State Sync on Expiration:** When the timer expired naturally, `onExpire()` was called to pause playback, but `playerStore.sleepTimer` was never set to `null`, so the UI showed the timer as still active.

**Fixes:**

1. **State-based countdown:** Changed interval to read and decrement from state instead of calculating from fixed `endTime`:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE: Used fixed endTime closure (broke extensions)
   let endTime = Date.now() + minutes * 60 * 1000;
   const remaining = Math.max(0, Math.ceil((endTime - Date.now()) / 1000));

   // AFTER: Read current state and decrement (extensions work correctly)
   const currentTimer = get().sleepTimer;
   const remaining = Math.max(0, currentTimer - 1);
   ```

2. **Sync playerStore on expiration:** The `onExpire` callback now also clears `playerStore.sleepTimer`:
   ```typescript
   useSleepTimerStore.getState().setSleepTimer(minutes, () => {
     get().pause();
     // CRITICAL: Sync state to playerStore when timer expires naturally
     set({ sleepTimer: null, sleepTimerInterval: null, isShakeDetectionActive: false });
   });
   ```

3. **UI reads from correct store:** Updated `SleepTimerSheet` and `SecretLibraryPlayerScreen` to read `sleepTimer` directly from `sleepTimerStore` for real-time countdown updates.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/stores/sleepTimerStore.ts` - Fixed countdown logic to use state-based decrement
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Added state sync in onExpire callback
- `src/features/player/sheets/SleepTimerSheet.tsx` - Read from sleepTimerStore directly
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Read from sleepTimerStore directly
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.54] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Downloaded Books Resume from Correct Position

**Problem:** After tapping play on a downloaded multi-file audiobook, playback started from the beginning instead of the saved position (e.g., chapter 61). The position was correctly retrieved (69845.8s) but the audio started at 0:00.

**Root Cause:** When building track metadata for offline multi-file audiobooks, the code used `book.media.audioFiles` for track durations. However, for downloaded books, this array has `duration: 0` for all tracks. Without correct track durations/offsets, the audio service couldn't calculate which track corresponds to position 69845.8s and defaulted to track 107 at position 0.

**Fix:** Updated the offline multi-file track building to use cached session's `audioTracks` for duration/offset metadata when available:

```typescript
// Priority: cached session tracks > book.media.audioFiles
const sessionTracks = cachedSession?.audioTracks || [];

audioTrackInfos = audioFileNames.map((fileName, index) => {
  const sessionTrack = sessionTracks[index];
  const bookFile = bookAudioFiles[index];
  // Use session track duration if available (most reliable)
  const duration = sessionTrack?.duration || bookFile?.duration || 0;
  const startOffset = sessionTrack?.startOffset ?? currentOffset;
  // ...
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Use cached session track metadata for offline playback
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.53] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Play Button Now Loads Book When Audio Not Loaded

**Problem:** Tapping the play button on a preloaded book (from previous session) did nothing because `play()` silently returned when audio wasn't loaded.

**Root Cause:** The `play()` function had an early return when `audioService.getIsLoaded()` was false. This was intended to prevent iOS background playback issues, but it broke the normal "tap to play" flow for preloaded books.

**Fix:** Updated `play()` to call `loadBook(autoPlay=true)` when audio isn't loaded but a book is available:

```typescript
if (!audioService.getIsLoaded()) {
  const bookToPlay = viewingBook || currentBook;
  if (bookToPlay) {
    await get().loadBook(bookToPlay, true); // autoPlay=true
    return;
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Updated `play()` to load book when audio not loaded
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.52] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Add Server Fetch as Chapter Fallback

**Problem:** Downloaded books still showed "0 chapters" because the cached LibraryItem object didn't have `media.chapters` populated, and all local fallbacks returned empty.

**Root Cause:** When a book is downloaded, the cached LibraryItem in memory/SQLite may have an empty `chapters` array, even though the server has 108 chapters. The 3-tier fallback (session → cache → metadata) all failed because none had the data locally.

**Fix:** Added a 4th fallback level that fetches fresh book data from the server via `apiClient.getItem(bookId)`. This ensures chapters are retrieved even when all local sources are empty.

**New Fallback Hierarchy:**
1. Session chapters (from current playback)
2. SQLite cached chapters (persisted)
3. Book metadata (from cached LibraryItem)
4. **NEW: Server fetch** (API call to `/api/items/{id}`)
5. Empty array (last resort)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/services/chapterCacheService.ts` - Added server fetch fallback and apiClient import
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.51] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Chapter Fallback for Preloaded/Viewed Books

**Problem:** Downloaded books showed "0 chapters" and wouldn't play because `preloadBookState` and `viewBook` functions extracted chapters directly from book metadata without using the fallback hierarchy.

**Root Cause:** When a book is restored from a previous session or viewed, the `extractChaptersFromBook()` function was called directly instead of `chapterCacheService.getChaptersWithFallback()`. For downloaded books where `book.media.chapters` is empty, this resulted in zero chapters being loaded.

**Fix:** Updated both `preloadBookState` and `viewBook` to use the chapter fallback service:
- Session chapters (from server)
- SQLite cached chapters (persisted)
- Book metadata chapters (last resort)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Updated `preloadBookState` and `viewBook` to use `chapterCacheService.getChaptersWithFallback()`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.50] - 2026-01-15

### Style: Search Page Theme Alignment

**Problem:** The search page styling didn't match the rest of the app - it used a red/gold accent color and the search bar didn't follow the pill-shaped design pattern.

**Changes:**
1. **Removed gold accent color** - Changed from `colors.gold` to theme-aligned black/white (black in light mode, white in dark mode)
2. **Search bar now pill-shaped** - Added `borderRadius: 20` for fully rounded corners with subtle border
3. **Centered placeholder text** - When search input is empty, placeholder text is centered; text left-aligns when typing
4. **QuickBrowseGrid full width** - Removed horizontal padding so grid spans full screen width like browse page

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/search/screens/SearchScreen.tsx` - Changed ACCENT to theme-aligned color
- `src/shared/components/TopNav.tsx` - Pill-shaped search bar with border, centered placeholder
- `src/features/search/components/QuickBrowseGrid.tsx` - Full width grid, neutral link color
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.49] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Player Logo Now Navigates to Library

**Problem:** Tapping the skull logo on the player screen did nothing.

**Root Cause:** The TopNav component's default `handleLogoPress` tried to navigate directly, but from a modal screen this doesn't work because the modal needs to be dismissed first.

**Fix:** Added a custom `onLogoPress` handler that:
1. Triggers haptic feedback
2. Closes the player (dismisses the modal)
3. Navigates to `LibraryTab` after a 300ms delay

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Added `handleLogoPress` handler
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.48] - 2026-01-15

### Enhancement: Chapter Cache Validation & Telemetry

Follow-up to v0.7.47 chapter persistence fix with production-ready enhancements.

**Cache Validation:**
- Added structured TTL validation with age tracking (hours/minutes)
- Added 1MB size limit protection with detailed logging
- Added JSON structure validation before parsing

**Telemetry & Debugging:**
- Comprehensive structured logging at each fallback level
- Load timing metrics (`loadTimeMs`) for performance monitoring
- Source tracking (`session`, `cache`, `metadata`, `empty`)
- Error recovery logging with detailed context

**Debug Utilities:**
- `getCacheStatus(bookId)` - Inspect cache state for any book
- `forceRefreshCache(bookId)` - Clear cache to force fresh load

**Log Examples:**
```
INFO: Chapters loaded from session { bookId, chapterCount: 25, loadTimeMs: 45, source: 'session' }
INFO: Chapters recovered successfully { bookId, source: 'cache', chapterCount: 25 }
WARN: Cached chapters expired { bookId, ageHours: 170, maxAgeHours: 168 }

## [0.7.47] - 2026-01-15

### Fix: Chapter Disappearance During Long Listening Sessions

**Problem:** After listening to a book for an extended period, chapters would disappear and the book would become unplayable. Only reinstalling the app would fix it.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Chapters only existed in Zustand memory - no persistence to SQLite
2. Session errors didn't preserve/restore chapters
3. Race condition: `closeSessionAsync()` nulled session before API completed
4. No fallback hierarchy when session data failed

**Solution:** Implemented robust chapter persistence with 3-tier fallback:
1. **Session chapters** - Fresh from server (primary)
2. **SQLite cache** - Persisted from last successful load (fallback)
3. **Book metadata** - Extracted from LibraryItem (last resort)

**Changes:**
- Added `chapters` and `chapters_updated_at` columns to `user_books` SQLite table
- Created `chapterCacheService` with fallback hierarchy logic
- Fixed session race condition - chapters backed up before session cleared
- Error handler now preserves chapters instead of leaving them empty
- Extended playback cache session expiry from 5 to 15 minutes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - Added chapter columns + accessor methods
- `src/features/player/services/chapterCacheService.ts` - **NEW** fallback service
- `src/features/player/services/sessionService.ts` - Fixed race condition, added chapter backup
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Integrated fallback + error recovery
- `src/core/services/playbackCache.ts` - Extended expiry, added fallback method
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.46] - 2026-01-14

### Fix: Player Title Displays Normally (Not Spine-Stacked)

**Problem:** The player was displaying titles in a spine-like stacked format (one word per line, uppercase), which looked odd for the player context. "Jade City" was showing as:
```
JADE
CITY
```

**Root Cause:** The player had a `splitTitle()` function that broke titles word-by-word, AND was applying `titleTransform: 'uppercase'` from the cached spine typography.

**Fix:**
1. Removed the `splitTitle()` usage - titles now display as-is
2. Only extract **font properties** from cached typography (fontFamily, fontWeight)
3. Do NOT apply spine-specific properties (uppercase transform, stacking, orientations)

**Before:** "JADE" / "CITY" (stacked, uppercase)
**After:** "Jade City" (normal display, wraps naturally)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Simplified title rendering
- `src/features/player/utils/positionResolver.ts` - Fixed null safety bug
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.45] - 2026-01-14

### Enhancement: Player Author Name Underlined as Link

Added underline styling to the author name in the player screen to visually indicate it's tappable (matches book detail screen behavior).

**Change:**
- Author text now shows `textDecorationLine: 'underline'` when `authorId` is available
- Tapping the author navigates to AuthorDetail screen

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Added underline to author text
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.44] - 2026-01-14

### Enhancement: Player Title Auto-Scales for Long Titles

Added `adjustsFontSizeToFit` to the player screen title text so long book titles automatically scale down to fit the available space.

**Props Added:**
- `adjustsFontSizeToFit` - Enables automatic font scaling
- `numberOfLines={4}` - Allows up to 4 lines for title + author
- `minimumFontScale={0.5}` - Won't shrink below 50% of original size

**Before:** Long titles could overflow or get cut off
**After:** Long titles scale down proportionally to fit

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Added adjustsFontSizeToFit to title Text
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.43] - 2026-01-14

### Fix: Book Detail/Player Now Match Spine Fonts Exactly

**Problem:** Book detail and player screens showed different fonts than the book spines on the home screen. For example, a Fantasy book would show `Lora-Regular` on book detail but `UncialAntiqua-Regular` on the spine.

**Root Cause:** The cache was using `getTypographyForGenres()` but the book spines use the **template system** when templates are available. The spine's rendering path:
1. Check if templates apply (`shouldUseTemplates(genres)`)
2. If yes, use `applyTemplateConfig()` to get font
3. Resolve font via `getPlatformFont()` to map custom fonts to available fonts

The cache was only using step 3 from the old typography system, missing the template lookup entirely.

**Fix:**
1. Import `shouldUseTemplates` and `applyTemplateConfig` from templateAdapter
2. Cache now checks if templates apply and uses them (same logic as spine)
3. Font names are resolved via `getPlatformFont()` (same as spine line 1654)

**Before:**
- Spine: `UncialAntiqua-Regular` (from epic-fantasy template)
- Book Detail: `Lora-Regular` (from genre typography fallback)

**After:**
- Spine: `UncialAntiqua-Regular`
- Book Detail: `UncialAntiqua-Regular` ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/stores/spineCache.ts` - Use template system when available, resolve fonts with `getPlatformFont()`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.42] - 2026-01-14

### Performance: Cache Typography for Cross-Screen Consistency

**Problem:** Book detail and player screens were computing typography (font family, weight, transforms) at render time, which could result in different fonts being selected than the book spines on the home screen.

**Solution:**
Pre-compute typography when library loads and cache it alongside dimensions, colors, and composition.

**Changes:**
1. Added `typography` field to `CachedSpineData` interface with all font properties:
   - fontFamily, fontWeight, fontStyle
   - titleTransform, authorTransform
   - letterSpacing, contrast, etc.
2. Call `getTypographyForGenres()` in `extractSpineData()` during cache population
3. Update `useSpineCache` hooks to expose typography in return values
4. Update book detail and player screens to use `cachedSpineData.typography` first, with fallback for books not in cache

**Benefits:**
- **Exact font matching**: Book spines, book detail, and player screens all use the SAME typography
- **No recomputation**: Typography computed once at app startup, not on every screen
- **Consistent experience**: Book appears with same font everywhere it's displayed

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/stores/spineCache.ts` - Added typography to cache extraction
- `src/features/home/hooks/useSpineCache.ts` - Exposed typography in hook return values
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Use cached typography first
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Use cached typography first
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.41] - 2026-01-14

### Feature: Stacked Author Names for Fantasy

Changed the Fantasy genre profile to prefer stacked (vertical word-by-word) author names instead of horizontal. This gives books like Terry Pratchett's "Witches Abroad" a more epic, classic spine look.

**Before:** Author horizontal at bottom
**After:** Author stacked vertically (word by word)

**Change:**
```tsx
// Old: ['vertical-up', 'vertical-down', 'oppose-title']
// New: ['stacked-words', 'vertical-up', 'stacked-words', 'vertical-down']
```

Duplicating `'stacked-words'` in the array makes it more likely to be selected (50% chance vs 25%).

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Fantasy authorOrientations
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.40] - 2026-01-14

### Fix: Use Complete Genre Font Library

**Problem:** Book detail and player screens were showing `Lora-Regular` font for most genres instead of the genre-specific fonts (like `PlayfairDisplay-Bold` for Fantasy).

**Root Cause:** The adapter's `getTypographyForGenres` was using the NEW genre profile system when the feature flag was enabled. However:
- **New system**: Only 3 genre profiles (fantasy, thriller, romance) - everything else falls back to default
- **Old system**: 42+ templates with diverse, genre-specific fonts

**Fix:** Changed `getTypographyForGenres()` in the adapter to ALWAYS use the old template system for font selection, regardless of feature flag. The new system still handles composition/layout - the systems complement each other.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/adapter.ts` - Always use old system for typography
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.39] - 2026-01-14

### Fix: Dark Mode Text in Library Filter Dropdowns

**Problem:** Filter dropdowns (View, Sort, Download Status) on the Library screen had nearly invisible text in dark mode - dark gray text (`#1A1A1A`) on dark background (`#0f0f0f`).

**Root Cause:** The dropdowns incorrectly used `colors.cream` for text color. In the Secret Library color system:
- Light mode: `cream` = `#e8e8e8` (light surface color)
- Dark mode: `cream` = `#1A1A1A` (dark surface color - NOT for text!)

The correct text color is `colors.black` which is automatically inverted:
- Light mode: `black` = `#000000`
- Dark mode: `black` = `#FFFFFF`

**Fix:** Replaced `isDarkMode ? colors.cream : colors.black` with just `colors.black` - the color system handles the inversion.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Fixed text colors in 3 dropdown modals
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.38] - 2026-01-14

### Performance: Pre-compute Spine Compositions at Startup

**Problem:** Spine styling (title orientation, author treatment, font choices) was computed at render time, causing:
- Delayed style application when viewing books
- Inconsistent styling across home, book detail, and player screens on reload
- Layout shifts as styles were computed

**Solution:**
Pre-compute spine compositions when library loads and cache them alongside dimensions and colors.

**Changes:**
1. Added `composition?: SpineComposition` field to `CachedSpineData` interface
2. Import and call `generateSpineComposition()` in `extractSpineData()` during cache population
3. Expose composition through `useSpineCache` hooks for easy access

**Benefits:**
- **Instant styling**: Book spines render with correct styling immediately
- **Consistency**: Same composition used across all screens (home, book detail, player)
- **No layout shift**: Styles are pre-computed, eliminating flash of unstyled content

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/stores/spineCache.ts` - Added composition to cache extraction
- `src/features/home/hooks/useSpineCache.ts` - Exposed composition in hook return values
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.37] - 2026-01-14

### Fix: Vertical Spine Text Centering

**Problem:** Vertical text on book spines (titles like "Voyager", "Kings of the Wyld") wasn't centering properly. Text appeared offset from the visual center.

**Root Cause:** React Native's `lineHeight` property centers the "line box" (fontSize + padding), not the visual text itself. When text is rotated 90°, this causes vertical misalignment.

**Solution:**
1. Removed `lineHeight` from single-line vertical text orientations (`vertical-up`, `vertical-down`)
2. Added unified centering utility functions (`shouldUseLineHeight`, `getSpineTextStyle`) with documentation

**Technical Details:**
- Horizontal and multi-line vertical text (`vertical-two-row`) still use `lineHeight` for proper line spacing
- Stacked orientations (`stacked-letters`, `stacked-words`) use `gap` instead of `lineHeight`
- Added `includeFontPadding: false` comment explaining its purpose

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Removed lineHeight from vertical-up/down orientations
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Added `shouldUseLineHeight()` and `getSpineTextStyle()` utilities
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.33] - 2026-01-14

### Complete Genre Template Library

Added 24 new spine templates for comprehensive genre coverage. Now 42 total templates.

**New Templates:**
- Mystery, Classics, Epic Fantasy, Self-Help
- Young Adult, Children, Non-Fiction, History
- Sports, Travel, Cooking, Health
- Military, Dystopian, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal Romance
- Poetry, Science, LitRPG, Cozy Mystery
- Espionage, Contemporary Fiction, Default (fallback)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added 24 new templates
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.32] - 2026-01-14

### Fix: Load New Fonts in APK

Added missing font loading for 11 new fonts in `appInitializer.ts`. Fonts were downloaded but not being loaded with `expo-font`, so they appeared as system defaults.

**Fonts now loaded:**
- GravitasOne, NotoSerif (Regular+Bold), LibreBaskerville (Regular+Bold)
- AlfaSlabOne, AlmendraSC, ZenDots, Eater, RubikBeastly, Barriecito

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Added Font.loadAsync() calls for new fonts
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.31] - 2026-01-14

### Default to Dark Mode

Changed default theme mode from light to dark for new installs.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/theme/themeStore.ts` - Changed default mode to 'dark'
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.30] - 2026-01-14

### Bug Fix: Skip Back Playback Issue

**Problem:** When pressing skip back while playing, audio would:
1. Jump back correctly
2. Play for ~1 second
3. Stop unexpectedly
4. First play press wouldn't work
5. Second play press would work

**Root Cause:** Race condition in `seekingStore.seekTo()` - the audio seek was fire-and-forget (not awaited), causing playback to continue from old position while seek was still processing.

**Fix:** Added `await` to `audioService.seekTo()` call so the function waits for the audio seek to complete before returning.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/stores/seekingStore.ts` - Line 211: Added await to audioService.seekTo()
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.29] - 2026-01-14

### Fixes and Font Downloads

**1. Fixed Thriller template layout**
- Changed from `stacked-words` (50% height) to `vertical-up` (72% height)
- Was causing "DUNGEON CRAWLER CARL" overlap issue
- Now matches typical vertical spine layout

**2. Width scaling with bump for 40+ hour epics**
- Linear scaling for most books (1-40 hours)
- Quadratic bump above 40 hours makes very long books look impressively thick
- Example: 40hr = ~232px, 45hr = ~250px, 50hr = 280px (MAX)

**3. Downloaded 9 new Google Fonts**
- GravitasOne, NotoSerif (Regular+Bold), LibreBaskerville (Regular+Bold)
- AlfaSlabOne, AlmendraSC, ZenDots
- Eater, RubikBeastly, Barriecito

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Fixed Thriller template
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/core/dimensions.ts` - Linear + bump scaling
- `src/assets/fonts/` - Added 11 new font files
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.28] - 2026-01-14

### Spine Improvements: Spacing, Scaling, and New Fonts

**1. Fixed stacked-words vertical spacing**
- Removed `flex: 1` that was causing words to spread out
- Words now pack tightly together with negative margins (30% overlap)
- Matches real book spine typography where words stack closely

**2. Logarithmic spine width scaling**
- Changed from linear to logarithmic scaling based on duration
- Short books spread out better (2hr book is now ~70px, not 49px)
- Long books still look thick but not absurdly wide
- Example widths: 1hr=44px, 5hr=115px, 10hr=150px, 20hr=190px, 50hr=280px

**3. Added 9 new Google Fonts for variety:**
- **Serif:** NotoSerif, LibreBaskerville (classic, traditional)
- **Display:** GravitasOne, AlfaSlabOne (bold, impactful)
- **Decorative:** AlmendraSC (vintage, small caps)
- **Futuristic:** ZenDots (tech, modern)
- **Playful:** Eater (horror), RubikBeastly (monster), Barriecito (quirky)

**4. Reduced Oswald-Bold/BebasNeue overuse:**
- Templates now use more varied fonts
- Each genre has appropriate typography personality
- Less generic, more distinctive per-genre styling

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Fixed stacked-words spacing
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/core/dimensions.ts` - Logarithmic width calculation
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - New fonts + template updates
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Font map + line heights for new fonts
- `src/constants/version.ts`

- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.26] - 2026-01-14

### Font Randomization Support

Added support for per-genre font randomization using `fontFamilies` array.

**How it works:**
- Templates can define `fontFamilies: ['Font1', 'Font2', 'Font3']` alongside `fontFamily`
- When rendering, a font is selected based on the book title hash (deterministic)
- Same book always gets same font, but different books get variety

**New functions:**
- `selectFontForBook(config, bookTitle)` - Selects font from fontFamilies array
- `hashString(str)` - Simple deterministic hash for font selection

**Usage example:**
```typescript
title: {
  fontFamily: 'Oswald-Bold',  // Default fallback
  fontFamilies: ['Oswald-Bold', 'BebasNeue-Regular', 'Lora-Bold'],  // Random selection
  // ... other config
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added fontFamilies field and selectFontForBook()
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templateAdapter.ts` - Uses selectFontForBook() when applying config
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Passes book title for font selection
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.25] - 2026-01-14

### Added Humor Template

**New template for comedy and humor books!**

**Humor Template Design:**
- **Font**: Oswald-Bold/Regular (clean, approachable sans-serif)
- **Title**: Vertical-up, uppercase, 48pt medium / 58pt large
- **Author**: Horizontal at bottom, uppercase
- **Feel**: Light and playful for comedic reads

**Matches genres:**
- humor, comedy, satire, parody, humorous-fiction

**Example:** "Witches Abroad" (Fantasy, Humor) now matches Humor template instead of Adventure fallback.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.24] - 2026-01-14

### Minimum Spine Width Increased to 44px

Increased minimum book spine width from 20px to 44px to match touch target guidelines.

**Changes:**
- `WIDTH_CALCULATION.MIN`: 20 → 44 (in `spine/constants.ts`)
- `MIN_WIDTH`: 20 → 44 (in `spineCalculations.ts`)

**Rationale:**
- 44px is the Apple HIG minimum touch target
- No more need for hitSlop padding on thin spines
- Ensures all spines are directly tappable
- Short audiobooks (<1hr) now get readable spine widths

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/constants.ts`
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.23] - 2026-01-14

### Added Fantasy Template

**New template for Fantasy genre books!**

Previously, Fantasy books were falling through to Adventure or Thriller templates based on their secondary genre. Now they get a dedicated epic fantasy look.

**Fantasy Template Design:**
- **Font**: PlayfairDisplay-Bold (classic serif for epic feel)
- **Title**: Vertical orientation, uppercase, bold
- **Author**: Stacked words at bottom (e.g., "NICHOLAS / EAMES")
- **Decoration**: Thin divider line between title and author
- **Sizes**: Responsive configs for small (38pt), medium (52pt), large (64pt) spines

**Matches genres:**
- fantasy, epic-fantasy, urban-fantasy, dark-fantasy, high-fantasy, sword-and-sorcery

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added Fantasy template
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.22] - 2026-01-14

### Template Renderer Fixes

**Fixes for TemplateSpineRenderer:**

1. **Font loading fixed** - Now passes `resolvedFontFamily` (via `getPlatformFont()`) to the template renderer instead of raw font names. This ensures custom fonts like PlayfairDisplay, Lora, etc. load correctly.

2. **Progress moved below spine** - For template-rendered books, progress is now shown BELOW the spine (externally) rather than inside it. Series numbers are hidden for now (can be added to templates later).

**Changes:**
- Added `resolvedFontFamily` prop to `TemplateSpineRenderer`
- Removed progress/series rendering from inside template renderer
- Added `progressBelowContainer` style for external progress display
- Progress shows as `XX%` below the book spine

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

---

## [0.7.21] - 2026-01-14

### Template-Direct Rendering - Clean Integration

**MAJOR REFACTOR:** Completely new rendering path for template-driven spines that mirrors SpineTemplatePreviewScreen exactly. This bypasses all the composition/solver complexity that was causing rendering issues.

**User Insight:**
> "Why can't we just use exactly how the template page is rendering them and pass in the values? It seems like a lot to have it translate everything."

**The Problem:**
Previous versions tried to:
1. Translate template configs through templateAdapter
2. Convert to composition objects
3. Run through layout solver to calculate fontSize
4. Apply results to Text components

This multi-layer translation was causing:
- Height allocation inversions (small fonts got huge space)
- Solver overriding template fontSize
- Orientation conversion bugs

**The Solution:**
Created `TemplateSpineRenderer` - a clean, isolated component that:
- Uses `heightPercent` DIRECTLY for section allocation (like SpinePreview)
- Applies `fontSize` DIRECTLY to Text components (no solver recalculation)
- Uses `adjustsFontSizeToFit` for overflow handling (shrinks but doesn't grow)
- Handles all orientations via simple transforms

**Code Architecture:**
```typescript
// When templates active: use clean direct rendering
{templateConfig ? (
  <TemplateSpineRenderer
    templateConfig={templateConfig}
    titleText={book.title}
    authorText={book.author}
    spineWidth={width}
    spineHeight={height}
    // ... direct props, no translation
  />
) : (
  // Fallback: composition-based rendering for non-template books
  <>...existing complex path...</>
)}
```

**Key Differences from Previous Approach:**
| Aspect | Old (v0.7.20) | New (v0.7.21) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Height calc | FROM fontSize | heightPercent DIRECT |
| Font size | Solver calculated | Template DIRECT |
| Orientation | Converted/translated | Used AS-IS |
| Rendering | Multiple code paths | Single clean renderer |

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Added TemplateSpineRenderer, conditional rendering path
- `src/constants/version.ts`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

## [0.7.20] - 2026-01-13

### Priority Order Fix - Composition Override

**FINAL FIX** for spine layout bug where templates correctly specified `author placement: bottom` but were being overridden by typography settings.

**Root Cause Found:**
User provided debug logs showing:
```json
{
  "layoutAuthorPos": "bottom",  ← Template says BOTTOM
  "hasAuthorBox": true,          ← Typography has author box
  "typographyAuthorPos": "top"   ← Typography says TOP
}
Result: authorFirst=true ← WRONG! Should be false
```

**The Problem:**
```typescript
// v0.7.19 (broken priority):
const authorFirstBeforeSafetyCheck =
  composition?.layout?.authorPosition === 'top' ||
  hasAuthorBox ||  // ❌ This overrode composition's "bottom"!
  typography.authorPosition === 'top';
```

Even though composition explicitly said `"bottom"`, the `hasAuthorBox` check (from series typography) was overriding it!

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// v0.7.20 (correct priority):
const compositionSaysBottom = composition?.layout?.authorPosition === 'bottom';
const compositionSaysTop = composition?.layout?.authorPosition === 'top';

const authorFirstBeforeSafetyCheck =
  compositionSaysTop ||  // Composition top - use it
  (!compositionSaysBottom && hasAuthorBox) ||  // ✅ Only if composition doesn't say bottom!
  (!compositionSaysBottom && !compositionSaysTop && typography.authorPosition === 'top');
```

**Priority Order (Correct):**
1. **Composition** (template-driven) - HIGHEST
2. **hasAuthorBox** (series typography) - MEDIUM
3. **typography.authorPosition** (fallback) - LOWEST

**Result:**
- Templates with `author placement: bottom` now correctly place authors at bottom
- Series typography can't override template decisions
- Traditional spine hierarchy: title prominent, author secondary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.19] - 2026-01-13

### Critical Safety Check Fix

**Fixed incomplete safety check** that allowed stacked author names to appear at the top of spines.

**The Problem:**
- v0.7.18's safety check only applied to `composition?.layout?.authorPosition === 'top'`
- It didn't protect against `hasAuthorBox` or `typography.authorPosition === 'top'`
- Series books with `authorBox: "horizontal-only"` could still get stacked authors at top
- Result: "NICHOLAS EAMES" appearing huge and stacked at top (exactly what user saw!)

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (v0.7.18 - incomplete):
const authorFirst =
  (composition?.layout?.authorPosition === 'top' && !authorHasStackedOrientation) ||
  hasAuthorBox || // ❌ No stacked check here!
  typography.authorPosition === 'top'; // ❌ Or here!

// AFTER (v0.7.19 - complete):
const authorFirstBeforeSafetyCheck =
  composition?.layout?.authorPosition === 'top' ||
  hasAuthorBox ||
  typography.authorPosition === 'top';

// ✅ Apply safety check to ALL cases:
const authorFirst = authorFirstBeforeSafetyCheck && !authorHasStackedOrientation;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Stacked author names (NICHOLAS / EAMES) are LARGE by design
- When placed at top, they dominate the spine (60-70% of height)
- Titles get squeezed small at bottom (backwards from tradition!)
- This safety check enforces: **Stacked authors ALWAYS go to bottom**

**Added Debug Log:**
```
[SAFETY] "Kings of the Wyld" has stacked author (stacked-words)
  - forcing to BOTTOM despite authorPosition=top
```

**Result:**
- Stacked authors now forced to bottom REGARDLESS of authorPosition/authorBox
- Traditional spine hierarchy restored: title prominent, author secondary
- Works for template-driven AND composition-driven spines

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

### Template Integration Fixes

**Critical fixes** to prevent incorrect spine layouts where author names appeared too prominently.

**Problems Fixed:**

1. **Missing Layout Property**
   - Template-based compositions were missing the `layout` object
   - Added `layout.authorPosition` from template's author placement
   - This ensures templates correctly specify author positioning

2. **Composition Priority Not Used**
   - Component wasn't checking `composition.layout.authorPosition`
   - Now prioritizes: composition → hasAuthorBox → typography
   - Templates can now control section ordering

3. **Stacked Author Names at Top**
   - Composition system sometimes generated `author: stacked-words, authorPosition: top`
   - This made author names dominate the spine (WRONG!)
   - Added safety check: blocks author-first when using stacked orientations
   - Result: Traditional spine layout (title prominent, author secondary)

4. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
   - Added logs for template matching: shows genre match or "NO MATCH"
   - Added logs for composition generation: shows author orientation & position
   - Helps diagnose layout issues in dev mode

**What Was Happening:**

```
BEFORE (broken):
┌─────────┐
│ NICHOLAS│ ← Author (stacked-words, large)
│  EAMES  │
│         │
│Kings of │ ← Title (small, at bottom)
│the Wyld │
└─────────┘
```

**What Happens Now:**

```
AFTER (fixed):
┌─────────┐
│ KINGS   │ ← Title (prominent, at top)
│  OF THE │
│   WYLD  │
│         │
│N. Eames │ ← Author (secondary, at bottom)
└─────────┘
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts`

## [0.7.17] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Template System Integration

**Major architectural enhancement:** Integrated the genre-specific spine template system into the main BookSpineVertical rendering component, bringing professional typography to all book spines throughout the app.

**What Changed:**

1. **Template Adapter Layer** (`templateAdapter.ts`)
   - Created bridge between template system and rendering component
   - Converts template configs to rendering format
   - Handles genre matching and size-based config selection
   - Provides fallback to generative composition system

2. **BookSpineVertical Integration**
   - Templates now drive spine styling for books with matching genres
   - Template fontSize becomes preferred target for layout solver
   - Template fontFamily overrides typography-based fonts
   - Template heightPercent controls section size allocation
   - Maintains backward compatibility with composition system

3. **Smart Genre Matching**
   - Prioritizes `preferredFor` genres (optimal matches)
   - Falls back to `usedFor` genres (compatible matches)
   - Graceful fallback for books without genre data

**How It Works:**

```typescript
// 1. Match book to template
const template = matchBookToTemplate(['science-fiction', 'space-opera']);
// → Returns "Science Fiction" template

// 2. Apply size-based config
const config = applyTemplateConfig(['science-fiction'], spineWidth);
// → Returns large config if width > 90px, medium if 60-90px, small if < 60px

// 3. Template drives rendering
// - fontSize: 58pt (template) → layout solver target
// - fontFamily: 'Orbitron-Regular' (futuristic)
// - orientation: 'vertical-up' (reads bottom-to-top)
// - heightPercent: 80% title, 10% author
```

**Template Priority:**
1. **Template system** (genre match found) → Uses template configs
2. **Composition system** (no genre match) → Uses generative layouts
3. **Typography system** (fallback) → Basic genre styling

**Benefits:**
- 16 professionally-designed genre templates now active
- Consistent styling across all matching books
- Size-responsive typography (small/medium/large spines)
- Publisher-quality font choices and sizing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templateAdapter.ts` (NEW)
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`

**Next Steps:**
- Test with 48 varied book examples from SpineTemplatePreviewScreen
- Fine-tune fontSize ranges for edge cases
- Consider exposing template customization to users

## [0.7.16] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Complete Size-Based Configurations

Added size-based styling configurations to all remaining 11 templates, completing the size-responsive system across all 16 genre templates.

**What's New:**

All 16 templates now feature comprehensive small/medium/large configurations:

1. ✅ **Literary Fiction** (v0.7.15)
2. ✅ **Science Fiction** (NEW)
3. ✅ **Technology** (NEW)
4. ✅ **Western** (v0.7.15)
5. ✅ **Art & Design** (v0.7.15)
6. ✅ **Adventure** (NEW)
7. ✅ **True Crime** (v0.7.15)
8. ✅ **Horror** (NEW)
9. ✅ **Romance** (NEW)
10. ✅ **Biography** (NEW)
11. ✅ **Philosophy** (NEW)
12. ✅ **Thriller** (v0.7.15)
13. ✅ **Historical Fiction** (NEW)
14. ✅ **Business** (NEW)
15. ✅ **Music & Arts** (NEW)
16. ✅ **Anthology** (NEW)

**Size Configuration Pattern:**

Each template now adapts across three breakpoints:

| Size | Width Range | Typical Changes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Small** | < 60px | Reduced font size (~25% smaller), tighter padding, switch to `vertical-up` for horizontal authors |
| **Medium** | 60-90px | Default config (balanced styling) |
| **Large** | > 90px | Increased font size (~15-20% larger), generous padding, enhanced letter spacing |

**Example: Science Fiction Template**

```typescript
title: {
  fontSize: 50,          // Medium default
  letterSpacing: 0.08,
  sizes: {
    small: {
      fontSize: 38,      // -24% for narrow spines
      letterSpacing: 0.06,
    },
    large: {
      fontSize: 58,      // +16% for wide spines
      letterSpacing: 0.10,
    },
  },
}
```

**Author Orientation Adaptations:**

For small spines (<60px), horizontal author orientations automatically switch to `vertical-up` to maximize readability:

- **Science Fiction**: `horizontal` → `vertical-up` (small)
- **Adventure**: `horizontal` → `vertical-up` (small)
- **Horror**: `horizontal` → `vertical-up` (small)
- **Romance**: `horizontal` → `vertical-up` (small)
- **Biography**: `horizontal` → `vertical-up` (small)
- **And all others...**

**Typography Adjustments:**

Each template respects its unique font family and style while scaling appropriately:

- **Serif fonts** (Playfair, Lora): Conservative scaling, refined letter spacing
- **Display fonts** (Orbitron, Federo): Bold scaling differences, dramatic spacing
- **Gothic fonts** (GrenzeGotisch, Uncial): Subtle adjustments, preserve character
- **Sans-serif** (Oswald, BebasNeue): Aggressive sizing, tight spacing on small

**Benefits:**

- **Consistency**: All 16 templates use the same breakpoints (60px, 90px)
- **Readability**: Small spines prioritize legibility over visual drama
- **Visual Impact**: Large spines maximize typography and letter spacing
- **Flexibility**: Each genre maintains its unique character while adapting to size
- **Maintainability**: Size logic lives in template definitions, not rendering code

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added size configs to 11 remaining templates (Science Fiction, Technology, Adventure, Horror, Romance, Biography, Philosophy, Historical Fiction, Business, Music & Arts, Anthology)
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.16

**System Status:**
- **Architecture**: ✅ Complete (v0.7.15)
- **Templates**: ✅ 16/16 with size configs (v0.7.16)
- **Rendering**: ✅ Uses `getConfigForSize()` helper (v0.7.15)

---

## [0.7.15] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Size-Based Styling System

Implemented a comprehensive size-based styling system that allows each genre template to specify different configurations for small, medium, and large spine widths.

**What's New:**

1. **Size-Based Configuration Architecture:**
   - Small: `< 60px` - Narrow spines optimized for readability
   - Medium: `60-90px` - Standard spines using balanced styling
   - Large: `> 90px` - Wide spines with maximum visual impact

2. **Flexible Override System:**
   Each template can now specify size-specific overrides:
   ```typescript
   title: {
     orientation: 'stacked-words',
     fontSize: 40,
     // ... default config
     sizes: {
       small: { orientation: 'vertical-up', fontSize: 32 },
       medium: { fontSize: 45 },
       large: { fontSize: 56, paddingHorizontal: 10 },
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Partial Overrides:**
   - Only specify properties that change per size
   - All unspecified properties inherit from default config
   - Clean, maintainable template definitions

4. **Helper Function:**
   New `getConfigForSize()` utility automatically selects the appropriate config based on spine width, merging size-specific overrides with defaults.

**Updated Templates with Size-Based Configs:**

Five templates now feature size-specific styling:

1. **Literary Fiction**
   - Small: `vertical-up`, fontSize 32
   - Medium: `stacked-words`, fontSize 40 (default)
   - Large: `stacked-words`, fontSize 48

2. **Western**
   - Small: `vertical-up`, fontSize 24
   - Medium: `vertical-two-row`, fontSize 30 (default)
   - Large: `vertical-two-row`, fontSize 36

3. **Art & Design**
   - Small: `vertical-up`, fontSize 38
   - Medium: `stacked-words`, fontSize 45
   - Large: `stacked-words`, fontSize 56

4. **True Crime**
   - Small: `vertical-up`, fontSize 48
   - Medium: `stacked-words`, fontSize 58
   - Large: `stacked-words`, fontSize 70

5. **Thriller**
   - Small: `vertical-up`, fontSize 58
   - Medium: `stacked-words`, fontSize 70
   - Large: `stacked-words`, fontSize 84

**Technical Implementation:**

- **TypeScript Interface:** Defined `BaseTitleConfig` and `BaseAuthorConfig` with optional `sizes` property
- **Type-Safe Overrides:** `TitleSizeOverride` and `AuthorSizeOverride` types ensure partial configs are type-safe
- **Cleaner Rendering:** Replaced hardcoded adaptive logic with declarative size configurations
- **Backwards Compatible:** Templates without `sizes` property work exactly as before

**Before vs After:**

| Approach | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Before (0.7.14)** | Hardcoded adaptive logic in renderer: `if (spineWidth < 70 && orientation === 'stacked-words') { ... }` |
| **After (0.7.15)** | Declarative size configs in templates: `sizes: { small: { orientation: 'vertical-up' } }` |

**Benefits:**

- **Maintainability:** Size logic lives in template definitions, not rendering code
- **Flexibility:** Each genre can define its own size breakpoint behaviors
- **Consistency:** All templates use the same size thresholds (60px, 90px)
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new size-based properties or adjust thresholds
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with partial override types

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added size-based TypeScript interfaces, updated 5 templates with size configs
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Replaced adaptive logic with `getConfigForSize()` calls
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.15

## [0.7.13] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Adaptive stacked-words for Narrow Spines

Reverted Art & Design, True Crime, and Thriller back to `stacked-words`, with adaptive behavior to switch to `vertical-up` on narrow spines.

**Changes:**

1. **Reverted Templates to stacked-words:**
   - Art & Design: `vertical-up` → `stacked-words`
   - True Crime: `vertical-up` → `stacked-words`
   - Thriller: `vertical-up` → `stacked-words`

2. **Added Adaptive Logic for stacked-words:**
   - Wide books (≥70px): Use `stacked-words` (word-by-word stacking: "THE" / "MIDNIGHT" / "LIBRARY")
   - Narrow books (<70px): Automatically switch to `vertical-up` (single vertical: "THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY")

**Behavior:**

| Spine Width | Template Config | Rendered As |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| ≥ 70px | `stacked-words` | Word-by-word stacking |
| < 70px | `stacked-words` | `vertical-up` (automatic fallback) |

**Why This Approach:**
- Wide spines: `stacked-words` creates dramatic word-by-word stacking
- Narrow spines: Automatic fallback to `vertical-up` prevents cramped text
- Best of both worlds - visual drama on wide books, readability on narrow

**Example - Art & Design Template:**
- **Wide book (80px)**: "THE" / "MIDNIGHT" / "LIBRARY" (dramatic stacking)
- **Narrow book (60px)**: "THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY" (clean vertical)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Reverted 3 templates to stacked-words
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Added stacked-words → vertical-up adaptive logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.13

---

## [0.7.12] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed Center Placement

Fixed `placement: 'center'` to properly center content on the spine instead of positioning it at the bottom.

**Problem:**
Templates with `placement: 'center'` were showing content bunched at the bottom of the spine instead of centered vertically. The title and author appeared at the bottom rather than in the middle: `[  ][█]` instead of `[|]`.

**Root Cause:**
The placement logic only handled author at top/bottom relative positioning, but didn't implement true centering for the title placement property. Content was stacked from the top down regardless of the `placement: 'center'` setting.

**Solution:**
Implemented proper center placement that calculates the total content height (title + author) and positions that block in the center of the spine:

```typescript
if (placement === 'center') {
  const contentHeight = titleHeight + authorHeight;
  const startY = (spineHeight - contentHeight) / 2;  // Center the block
  // Position title and author within centered block
}
```

**Behavior Now:**

| Placement | Position | Visual |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `'center'` | Content centered on spine | `[  \|  ]` |
| `'top'` | Content at top of spine | `[█    ]` |
| `'bottom'` | Content at bottom of spine | `[    █]` |

**Example:**
True Crime template with 68% title + 20% author = 88% content:
- **Before:** Content positioned from top, ended near bottom
- **After:** 88% content block centered, with equal space above and below

**Affected Templates:**
All templates with `placement: 'center'` now properly center:
- Literary Fiction
- Science Fiction
- Technology
- True Crime
- And others...

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Implemented proper center placement logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.12

## [0.7.11] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed Padding for vertical-up/vertical-down

Fixed padding not working for `vertical-up` and `vertical-down` orientations (same issue that affected vertical-two-row).

**Problem:**
Setting `paddingVertical: 10` or `paddingHorizontal` had no visible effect on vertical-up/vertical-down orientations. The rotated View was using absolute dimensions that didn't account for the padding applied to the parent container.

**Solution:**
Applied the same padding calculation fix used for vertical-two-row:

```typescript
// For vertical-up/vertical-down
const paddingH = config.paddingHorizontal ?? 3;
const paddingV = config.paddingVertical ?? 0;
// After rotation: vertical padding affects width, horizontal padding affects height
const rotatedWidth = height - (paddingV * 2);
const rotatedHeight = width - (paddingH * 2);
```

**Affected Orientations:**
- ✅ Title with `vertical-up` orientation
- ✅ Title with `vertical-down` orientation
- ✅ Author with `vertical-up` orientation
- ✅ Author with `vertical-down` orientation

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'literary-fiction',
  title: {
    orientation: 'vertical-up',
    paddingHorizontal: 0,    // ✓ Now working
    paddingVertical: 10,     // ✓ Now working (creates top/bottom space after rotation)
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Technical Note:**
After -90° rotation (vertical-up):
- `paddingVertical` creates space at the top/bottom of the spine (becomes left/right after rotation)
- `paddingHorizontal` creates space at the left/right of the spine (becomes top/bottom after rotation)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Fixed padding calculation for vertical orientations
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.11

---

## [0.7.10] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed Orientation for Art & Design, True Crime, Thriller

Changed three templates from problematic orientations to clean single-column `vertical-up`.

**Templates Updated:**

1. **Art & Design**
   - **Before:** `stacked-words` (title split word-by-word: "THE" / "MIDNIGHT" / "LIBRARY")
   - **After:** `vertical-up` (clean vertical text: "THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY")
   - **Author:** Changed from `stacked-words` to `horizontal` for better readability

2. **True Crime**
   - **Before:** `horizontal` with `wordsPerLine: 2` (caused odd breaks: "DU" / "NE")
   - **After:** `vertical-up` (clean vertical text: "DUNE")
   - Removed `maxLines` and `wordsPerLine` properties

3. **Thriller**
   - **Before:** `horizontal` with `wordsPerLine: 1` (caused character splits: "TH" / "E")
   - **After:** `vertical-up` (clean vertical text: "THE")
   - Removed `maxLines` and `wordsPerLine` properties

**Why the Change:**
- `stacked-words` breaks text word-by-word, not ideal for multi-word titles
- `horizontal` with `wordsPerLine` on narrow spines causes awkward mid-word breaks
- `vertical-up` provides clean, readable vertical text that auto-scales properly

**Consistency:**
All three templates now use:
- Title: `vertical-up` orientation
- Author: `horizontal` orientation (standard pattern)
- Standard padding: `paddingHorizontal: 4, paddingVertical: 8`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Updated 3 templates
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.10

---

## [0.7.9] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Adaptive vertical-two-row for Narrow Spines

Added automatic fallback from `vertical-two-row` to `vertical-up` orientation when spines are too narrow to accommodate two columns.

**Problem:**
On narrow books (< 70px width), `vertical-two-row` text would try to split into two very narrow columns, creating cramped and hard-to-read typography.

**Solution:**
Automatic adaptive orientation that switches rendering mode based on spine width:

```typescript
// Adaptive title orientation
if (spineWidth < 70 && titleConfig.orientation === 'vertical-two-row') {
  // Switch to single-column vertical-up
  orientation: 'vertical-up',
  maxLines: 1,  // Single line for regular vertical
}
```

**Behavior:**

| Spine Width | Template Config | Rendered As |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| ≥ 70px | `vertical-two-row` | Two vertical columns (as designed) |
| < 70px | `vertical-two-row` | `vertical-up` (automatic fallback) |

**Example:**
The Western template uses `vertical-two-row`:
- **Wide books (80px+)**: "THE SONG" | "OF ACHILLES" (two columns)
- **Narrow books (<70px)**: "THE SONG OF ACHILLES" (single vertical column)

**Applies To:**
- Title orientation (70px threshold)
- Author orientation (70px threshold)
- Works seamlessly with existing adaptive logic (horizontal → stacked-words at 55px)

**Why 70px Threshold:**
- Typical two-column layout needs ~35px per column minimum
- Below 70px, columns become too narrow for readable text
- Single vertical column provides better readability on narrow spines

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Added adaptive logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.9

---

## [0.7.8] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed Padding & Text Alignment

Fixed padding not working for vertical-two-row and added text alignment support to all orientations.

**Padding Fix for vertical-two-row:**

**Problem:** Padding wasn't working properly for vertical-two-row orientation. Setting `paddingHorizontal: 12` or `paddingVertical: 11` had no visible effect.

**Root Cause:** The rotated View was using absolute dimensions (titleHeight and spineWidth) that didn't account for the padding applied to the parent container.

**Solution:** Calculate rotated dimensions after subtracting padding:
```typescript
// Account for padding in rotated dimensions
const paddingH = titleConfig.paddingHorizontal ?? 3;
const paddingV = titleConfig.paddingVertical ?? 0;
// After -90° rotation: vertical padding affects width, horizontal padding affects height
const rotatedWidth = titleHeight - (paddingV * 2);
const rotatedHeight = spineWidth - (paddingH * 2);
```

**Text Alignment Support:**

Added `align` property support to ALL orientations (was only partially implemented):

1. **Horizontal Text** - Already working ✓
2. **Vertical Text (vertical-up, vertical-down)** - Now respects `align: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'`
3. **vertical-two-row** - Now respects `align: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'`
4. **Author Text** - Now respects align for all orientations (was hardcoded to 'center' for vertical)

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'western',
  title: {
    orientation: 'vertical-two-row',
    align: 'center',           // ✓ Now working
    paddingHorizontal: 12,     // ✓ Now working
    paddingVertical: 11,       // ✓ Now working
    // ...
  }
}
```

**All Templates Updated:**
All 16 templates now have `align: 'center'` set explicitly for both title and author.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Fixed padding calculation and text alignment
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added align to all templates
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.8

---

## [0.7.7] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - All Properties Now Working for vertical-two-row

Fixed vertical-two-row to respect all template properties: `letterSpacing`, `maxLines`, `textSplitPercent`, `lineHeight`, etc.

**Properties Now Working:**

1. **letterSpacing** - Controls horizontal spacing between characters:
   ```typescript
   letterSpacing: 1  // Adds 1px between letters
   ```

2. **maxLines** - Controls maximum number of lines (not hardcoded to 2 anymore):
   ```typescript
   maxLines: 3  // Allow up to 3 lines instead of 2
   ```

3. **textSplitPercent** - Controls where to split text between lines:
   ```typescript
   textSplitPercent: 51  // First line gets 51% of words
   ```

4. **lineHeight** - Optional override for line spacing:
   ```typescript
   lineHeight: 55  // Fixed line height (use sparingly with adjustsFontSizeToFit)
   ```

**Example Western Template:**
All these properties now work together properly:
```typescript
{
  id: 'western',
  title: {
    orientation: 'vertical-two-row',
    fontSize: 30,
    letterSpacing: 1,        // ✓ Now working
    maxLines: 3,             // ✓ Now working
    textSplitPercent: 51,    // ✓ Now working
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `letterSpacing` to style object when defined
- Changed `numberOfLines={2}` to `numberOfLines={titleConfig.maxLines ?? 2}`
- Both title and author orientations now respect all properties

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Added missing property support
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.7

---

## [0.7.6] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed adjustsFontSizeToFit for vertical-two-row

Fixed auto-scaling by removing the default lineHeight constraint that was preventing proper text fitting.

**Problem:**
- `adjustsFontSizeToFit` was not working properly with `lineHeight: fontSize * 0.8`
- When text scaled down to fit, the fixed lineHeight stayed constant, preventing proper fitting
- Users had to manually reduce fontSize from 72 to 30 to make text fit

**Solution:**
- Removed the automatic lineHeight default for vertical-two-row orientation
- Only applies lineHeight if explicitly set in template config
- Allows `adjustsFontSizeToFit` to scale text naturally with automatic line height
- Text now properly scales down to fit the available space

**Technical Explanation:**
When `adjustsFontSizeToFit` scales the fontSize down (e.g., from 72pt to 40pt), a fixed `lineHeight: 57.6` (72 * 0.8) becomes larger than the scaled fontSize (40pt), causing layout issues. By letting lineHeight be automatic, it scales proportionally with the fontSize.

**Before:**
```typescript
lineHeight: titleConfig.lineHeight ?? titleConfig.fontSize * 0.8  // Broken!
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only use lineHeight if template explicitly provides it
...(titleConfig.lineHeight ? { lineHeight: titleConfig.lineHeight } : {})
```

**To Control Line Spacing:**
Templates can still explicitly set lineHeight if needed:
```typescript
title: {
  orientation: 'vertical-two-row',
  fontSize: 72,
  lineHeight: 55,  // Explicit override still works
  // ...
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Fixed lineHeight logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.6

---

## [0.7.5] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Configurable Text Split for vertical-two-row

Added `textSplitPercent` property to control where text splits between the two lines in vertical-two-row orientation.

**Changes:**

1. **New Property: `textSplitPercent`** - Controls split point for two-line text:
   - Default: `50` (split at 50% of words)
   - Range: `0-100` (percentage of words for first line)
   - Available for both title and author configs
   - Examples:
     - `textSplitPercent: 50` → "THE SONG OF\nACHILLES" (2 words / 2 words)
     - `textSplitPercent: 33` → "THE SONG\nOF ACHILLES" (1 word / 3 words)
     - `textSplitPercent: 66` → "THE SONG OF ACHILLES\n" (3 words / 1 word)

2. **How It Works:**
   - Splits text into words: `["THE", "SONG", "OF", "ACHILLES"]`
   - Calculates split point: `Math.ceil(words.length * (textSplitPercent / 100))`
   - Inserts line break: `"THE SONG\nOF ACHILLES"`
   - Text component wraps naturally at the newline
   - After -90° rotation, each line becomes a vertical column

3. **Why This Matters:**
   - Balances text between two vertical columns
   - Default 50% split ensures equal distribution
   - Templates can customize for specific titles (e.g., 33% for shorter first column)
   - Works with lineHeight to control column spacing

**Example Template:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'western',
  title: {
    orientation: 'vertical-two-row',
    fontSize: 72,
    lineHeight: 55,
    textSplitPercent: 50,  // Split at 50% of words
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Example Output:**
```
"THE SONG OF ACHILLES" (4 words, textSplitPercent: 50)
→ Split at word 2 (50% of 4)
→ "THE SONG\nOF ACHILLES"
→ After rotation: two vertical columns with 2 words each
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added textSplitPercent property
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Implemented split logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.5

## [0.7.4] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed vertical-two-row with Natural Text Wrapping

Simplified vertical-two-row implementation to use natural text wrapping instead of manual column splitting.

**Changes:**

1. **Simplified Rendering** - Replaced complex two-column splitting logic with single Text component:
   - **Before:** Split text into two parts, create two separate Text components with `numberOfLines={1}`, rotate each independently
   - **After:** Single Text component with `numberOfLines={2}`, let it wrap naturally, rotate once
   - Now lineHeight actually works to control spacing between the two lines (which become columns after rotation)

2. **Why This Works Better:**
   - React Native's text wrapping algorithm handles word breaks intelligently
   - `adjustsFontSizeToFit` works properly with multi-line text and lineHeight
   - Single rotation transform is more performant than multiple transforms
   - Consistent with how other orientations (vertical-up, horizontal) are rendered

3. **LineHeight Now Functional:**
   - Title text: `lineHeight: fontSize * 0.8` (default 80% of font size)
   - Author text: `lineHeight: fontSize * 0.8` (default 80% of font size)
   - Controls spacing between wrapped lines (which appear as column spacing after rotation)
   - Templates can override: `lineHeight: 55` for custom spacing

**Example:**
```typescript
// Simple, elegant implementation
<View style={{ transform: [{ rotate: '-90deg' }] }}>
  <Text
    numberOfLines={2}
    adjustsFontSizeToFit
    style={{ lineHeight: fontSize * 0.8 }}
  >
    THE SONG OF ACHILLES
  </Text>
</View>
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Simplified vertical-two-row rendering
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.7.4

---

## [0.7.2-0.7.3] - 2026-01-13

### (Superseded by 0.7.4)

Earlier attempts using letterSpacing and lineHeight with split columns. Replaced with natural text wrapping approach.

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Two-Column Vertical Layout

Added new `vertical-two-row` orientation for splitting vertical text across two side-by-side columns.

**New Orientation: `vertical-two-row`**

Renders text in two vertical columns reading bottom-to-top, perfect for long titles that need more space.

**Example:**
```
"THE SONG OF ACHILLES"

Single vertical-up:     Two-column vertical-two-row:
S  E  L  I  H  C  A     T  S     O  A  C  H  I  L  L  E  S
                        H  O     F
                        E  N
                           G
```

**How It Works:**
- Splits text by words at the midpoint
- Left column: First half of words
- Right column: Remaining words
- Each column rotated -90° (vertical-up)
- Both columns auto-scale independently with `adjustsFontSizeToFit`

**Usage:**
```typescript
title: {
  orientation: 'vertical-two-row',  // NEW!
  fontSize: 172,
  weight: '400',
  fontFamily: 'Notable-Regular',
  case: 'uppercase',
  placement: 'center',
  heightPercent: 85,
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Long book titles that don't fit comfortably in single vertical column
- Western/frontier aesthetics where bold stacked text is desired
- Art deco designs with columnar typography
- Wide spines where vertical space can be split

**Available For:**
- Title orientation
- Author orientation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added orientation type
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Implemented rendering
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Major Curation & Refinement

Curated spine template library down to 16 genre-specific templates with professional polish.

**Changes:**

1. **Template Curation** - Reduced from 56 to 16 essential templates:
   - Literary Fiction
   - Science Fiction
   - Technology
   - Western
   - Art & Design
   - Adventure
   - True Crime
   - Horror
   - Romance
   - Biography
   - Philosophy
   - Thriller
   - Historical Fiction
   - Business
   - Music & Arts
   - Anthology

2. **Removed All Decorations** - Eliminated decorative lines and borders:
   - All templates now use `decoration: { element: 'none', lineStyle: 'none' }`
   - Clean, minimal aesthetic across all designs
   - Focus on typography, not ornamentation

3. **Added Consistent Padding** - All templates now have proper spacing:
   - Title: `paddingHorizontal: 4-8px, paddingVertical: 8px`
   - Author: `paddingHorizontal: 8px, paddingVertical: 6px`
   - Prevents text from touching spine edges
   - Better readability and professional appearance

4. **Genre-Specific Naming** - Renamed all templates to match genres directly:
   - Old: `minimal-serif`, `futuristic-scifi`, `western-noir`
   - New: `literary-fiction`, `science-fiction`, `western`
   - Easier to understand template purpose at a glance

5. **Removed Duplicates** - Eliminated redundant templates:
   - Removed overlapping designs (e.g., multiple sci-fi variants)
   - Each genre now has one definitive template
   - Cleaner template selection experience

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Major version bump to 0.7.0

**Migration Notes:**

- Template IDs changed - update any hardcoded references
- Decoration system still exists but unused in core templates
- All utility functions (getTemplate, getTemplatesForGenre) remain unchanged

---

## [0.6.380] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Adaptive Author Orientation for Narrow Spines

Added automatic adaptation that switches horizontal author text to stacked-words when spine width is less than 55px.

**Problem:**
- Narrow spines (40px) with horizontal author text often had text that was too small to read
- Long author names would shrink excessively to fit narrow widths
- User feedback: "horizontal author text doesn't work well on thin spines"

**Solution:**
- Added `adaptiveAuthorConfig` logic that detects spine width at render time
- When `spineWidth < 55px` AND `author.orientation === 'horizontal'`
  → Automatically switches to `stacked-words` orientation
- Original template definition remains unchanged
- Adaptation happens dynamically during rendering

**Behavior:**
- **Wide spines (≥55px):** Author renders as specified in template
- **Narrow spines (<55px):** Horizontal authors automatically become stacked-words
- Vertical and already-stacked authors are not affected

**Example:**
```
Template: author.orientation = 'horizontal'

Rendered at 80px width: MATT HAIG (horizontal)
Rendered at 40px width: MATT       (stacked-words)
                        HAIG
```

**Benefits:**
- Better readability on thin spine views
- No template modifications required
- Consistent behavior across all 56 templates
- Respects designer intent while optimizing for narrow displays

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Added adaptive logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.379] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Fixed Text Clipping in Stacked Orientations

Completely rewrote vertical spacing logic for stacked text to prevent clipping with adjustsFontSizeToFit.

**Root Cause:**
- Setting `lineHeight < fontSize` on Text components causes clipping
- Previous logic: `fontSize: 50.4px, lineHeight: 42px` → text clipped at top/bottom
- `adjustsFontSizeToFit` + constrained lineHeight = guaranteed clipping

**Solution:**
- Removed `lineHeight` from stacked Text components entirely
- Moved spacing control to parent View using `gap` property
- Gap uses negative values to pull words/letters closer together
- Text now has full natural height, no clipping

**New Spacing Defaults:**
- Stacked words (title): `gap: fontSize * -0.15` (15% overlap)
- Stacked words (author): `gap: fontSize * -0.1` (10% overlap)
- Stacked letters (title): `gap: fontSize * -0.2` (20% overlap)
- Stacked letters (author): `gap: fontSize * -0.15` (15% overlap)

**Custom Spacing:**
- Use `lineHeightScale` in templates to control gap dynamically
- `lineHeightScale: 0.5` → Tighter stacking (50% more overlap)
- `lineHeightScale: 1.0` → Natural spacing (no overlap)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Rewrote stacked rendering
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.378] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - MaxLines Support for Stacked Orientations

Fixed stacked orientations to respect the `maxLines` property instead of using hardcoded limits.

**Bug Fixed:**
- `stacked-words` was hardcoded to show only 2 words (now respects `maxLines`, default 10)
- `stacked-letters` was hardcoded to show only 4 letters (now respects `maxLines`, default 20)
- "Project Hail Mary" now correctly shows all 3 words when `maxLines: 3` is set

**Behavior:**
- `maxLines: 3` on stacked-words → Shows up to 3 words
- `maxLines: 20` on stacked-letters → Shows up to 20 letters
- Omit `maxLines` → Shows all words/letters (up to reasonable defaults)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Updated slice limits
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.377] - 2026-01-13

### Spine Templates - Stacked Author Orientations

Added stacked text options for author names, matching the title orientation capabilities.

**New Author Orientations:**
- `stacked-letters` - Each letter of author name on separate line (e.g., "S\nT\nE\nP\nH\nE\nN")
- `stacked-words` - Each word of author name on separate line (e.g., "STEPHEN\nKING")

**Properties Added:**
- `letterSpacing` - Control spacing between stacked letters (works with both stacked orientations)

**Use Cases:**
- Celebrity author branding (Stephen King, James Patterson)
- Anthology collections with "Various Authors"
- Experimental indie designs with vertical emphasis
- Limited spine width where horizontal text doesn't fit

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/utils/spine/templates/spineTemplates.ts` - Added orientation types and letterSpacing
- `src/features/home/screens/SpineTemplatePreviewScreen.tsx` - Implemented stacked rendering logic
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

## [0.6.370] - 2026-01-11

### Unified Progress Data Architecture

Major refactoring to eliminate fragmented progress data and provide instant UI updates.

**Problem:** Progress data existed in 5+ places that could become out of sync:
- Server `/api/me/items-in-progress`
- Server `/api/me` (mediaProgress array)
- SQLite `user_books` table
- SQLite `playback_progress` table (legacy)
- libraryCache (item.userMediaProgress)
- spineCache (CachedSpineData.progress)
- playerStore (currentPosition)

**Solution:** Created unified progressStore as single source of truth.

**New Files:**
- `src/core/stores/progressStore.ts` - Unified progress store
  - In-memory Map backed by SQLite user_books table
  - Version counter for reactive subscribers
  - Methods: loadFromDatabase, updateProgress, markFinished, getInProgressBookIds
  - Debounced SQLite writes for performance during playback
  - setupProgressSubscribers() wires up spineCache updates

**Modified Files:**
- `src/core/stores/index.ts` - Export progressStore
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Load progressStore during init
- `src/features/player/services/backgroundSyncService.ts` - Notify progressStore on save
- `src/shared/hooks/useContinueListening.ts` - Read from progressStore (local-first)

**Data Flow (After):**
```
Player updates → progressStore.updateProgress()
                       ↓
              SQLite write (debounced)
                       ↓
              In-memory Map update
                       ↓
    ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
    ↓                 ↓                 ↓
spineCache     useContinue       backgroundSync
re-renders     Listening          queues server
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant progress updates (no refresh needed)
- Spine progress bars update during playback
- Continue Listening updates immediately on pause
- Works offline with cached data
- Single source of truth eliminates sync issues

**Verification:**
- [x] Single source of truth: SQLite via progressStore
- [x] spineCache subscribes to progressStore
- [x] useContinueListening reads from progressStore
- [x] backgroundSyncService notifies progressStore
- [ ] Full end-to-end testing pending

### Test Suite Fixes (41 → 0 Failing Tests)

Fixed all 41 failing tests across 6 test suites.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. `metadata.ts` - Handle narrator objects `{ name: string }` in arrays
2. `progressCalculator.test.ts` - Correct test for 95% threshold (98% is complete)
3. `EmptyState.test.tsx` - Add `useThemeColors`, `iconSizes`, `accentColors` mocks
4. `ErrorView.test.tsx` - Add complete theme mock suite
5. `HorizontalBookItem.test.tsx` - Add theme mocks with progress colors
6. `websocketService.test.ts` - Fix socket.io mock to pass URL/options

- `src/core/cache/__tests__/useCoverUrl.test.ts` (7 tests)
  - Tests for cache-busting timestamps
  - Tests for query parameter handling
  - Tests for options passthrough

**Test Results:** 703 passing (31 new cache tests added)

- Uses expo-image's `Image.prefetch()` for efficient preloading
- Configurable prefetch distance (default: 10 items ahead)
- Tracks prefetched items to avoid duplicate fetches
- Includes `createPrefetchTracker()` utility for manual tracking

**Integration:**
- Added to `FilteredBooksScreen` with `prefetchAhead: 12` (4 rows in 3-column grid)
- Connects to FlatList's `onViewableItemsChanged` and `viewabilityConfig`

#### Manual Sync Retry Button (P3)

**New Store:** `src/core/stores/syncStatusStore.ts`
- Zustand store for reactive sync status in UI
- Tracks: pendingCount, isSyncing, isOnline, lastError, lastSyncedAt
- Actions: refreshStatus(), retrySync(), setSyncing(), setError(), setOnline()
- Auto-subscribes to eventBus for sync events
- Auto-subscribes to networkMonitor for connectivity changes
- Periodic refresh every 30 seconds
- Provides selectors: usePendingSyncCount, useIsSyncing, useHasSyncErrors, useSyncStatus

**New Component:** `src/shared/components/SyncStatusBanner.tsx`
- Visual banner showing sync status with retry capability
- Shows when: offline with pending syncs, sync failed, items pending
- Hides automatically when all synced
- Displays "Retry" button when errors occur and online
- Uses lucide-react-native icons (Cloud, CloudOff, RefreshCw, AlertCircle)
- Adapts to theme colors

**Files Created:**

## [0.6.368] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed Series Navigation from Book Detail Page

**Problem:** Tapping series name on book detail page showed "Series not found" error.

**Root Cause:** The library cache indexed series using `metadata.seriesName`, but some books only have series info in `metadata.series[0].name` (with `seriesName` being undefined). These books weren't being indexed.

**Fix:** Updated `buildIndexes()` in `libraryCache.ts` to check both formats:
1. First tries `metadata.seriesName`
2. Falls back to `metadata.series[0].name` if seriesName is undefined

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/cache/libraryCache.ts` - Fixed series indexing to handle both metadata formats

**Testing:** After this fix, force refresh the library cache (pull-to-refresh on library) to rebuild indexes, then tap any series name on a book detail page.

## [0.6.367] - 2026-01-11

### TypeScript Error Fixes & Type Safety Improvements

Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors (12 errors → 0 errors).

**BookMetadata Type Extensions:**
- Added `narratorName?: string` - first narrator name for display
- Added `rating?: number` - optional rating (if enabled on server)
- Added `ratingCount?: number` - number of ratings

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/core/types/media.ts` - Extended BookMetadata interface
- `src/features/home/components/TextListSection.tsx` - Fixed undefined `bookAny` variable in debug code
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Added missing MediaProgress properties (`hideFromContinueListening`, `startedAt`)

- `src/core/hooks/useOptimisticMutation.ts` - Fixed CollectionBookRef[] type mismatch with explicit cast

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- Current `any` count: 109 casts + 189 annotations = ~298 total
- Tests: 630/671 passing (failures are test infrastructure issues)

**P2/P3 Item Status:**
| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| SQLite corruption detection | Defer |

## [0.6.365] - 2026-01-11

### Codebase Cleanup - Phases 11-15: Type Safety Improvements

Major type safety cleanup across the codebase, reducing `as any` casts from 201 to 109 (92 removed, 46% reduction).

**Key Patterns Established:**
- Type guards: `isBookMedia()` for checking if media has book properties (duration, chapters)
- Helper functions: `getBookMetadata()` returning `BookMetadata | null` with `mediaType` check

- Global type extensions: Platform-specific APIs (ErrorUtils, performance.memory) properly typed

**Phase 11 - Core Player & Sync (18 casts removed):**
- `playerStore.ts` - Added type guards for audioFiles, metadata, duration access
- `finishedBooksSync.ts` - Fixed userMediaProgress and mediaProgress access
- `useReadingHistory.ts` - Proper getMetadata return type

**Phase 12 - Library & Discovery (20 casts removed):**
- `FilteredBooksScreen.tsx` - Added getBookDuration helper
- `useLibraryData.ts` - Removed unnecessary userMediaProgress casts
- `usePopularContent.ts` - Type guards for duration and metadata
- `errors.ts` - Created hasErrorFlag helper for duck-typing error checks

**Phase 13 - Mutations & Monitoring (12 casts removed):**
- `useOptimisticMutation.ts` - Added RollbackContext, CollectionBookRef, CollectionData types
- `runtimeMonitor.ts` - Declared global types for ErrorUtils, PerformanceMemory

**Phase 15 - Final Cleanup (17+ casts removed):**
- `ContinueListeningSection.tsx`, `ContinueListeningHero.tsx` - Progress access
- `discover/types.ts`, `SearchScreen.tsx` - BookSummary conversion

**Metrics:**
- `as any` count reduced: 201 → 109 (92 fewer casts, 46% reduction)

## [0.6.360] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed Android Playback for Multi-File Audiobooks

Fixed an issue where certain audiobooks wouldn't play on Android even when downloaded, while working fine on iOS.

**Root Cause:**
- Downloaded files were saved with hardcoded `.m4a` extension regardless of actual format
- Android's ExoPlayer is strict about file extensions matching actual codec
- iOS is more forgiving and detects codec from file header

**Fixes:**
- Download manager now preserves original file extension from server metadata
- Added platform-specific logging for debugging file loading issues
- Improved error messages to show actual error instead of generic message
- Added file existence verification before loading on Android

**Also improved:**
- Error messages now include actual error details for debugging
- Added logging for platform and track URL during audio loading

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/downloadManager.ts` - Use original file extension, add logging
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Add file verification and platform logging
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Better error messages with actual error
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.360

**Note:** Previously downloaded books may need to be re-downloaded to fix playback issues.

## [0.6.351] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed: "Unknown Title/Author" Bug on Library and Browse Screens

Fixed critical bug where book titles and authors showed as "Unknown" despite metadata being present in the library cache.

**Root Cause:**
The `isBookMedia` type guard required `audioFiles` to be present in `item.media`, but library cache items don't include `audioFiles` to save space. This caused `getMetadata()` to return null even when metadata was available.

**Fix:**
- Updated `getMetadata()` in `src/shared/utils/metadata.ts` to check `item?.media?.metadata` directly
- Updated `getBookMetadata()` in `src/features/browse/components/TasteTextList.tsx` similarly
- Updated `LibraryScreen.tsx` to use full library cache (`allCacheItems`) instead of just `recentlyListened` and `recentlyAdded`

**Impact:**
- Library screen now shows all 2400+ books from cache with correct titles/authors
- Browse page "Based on Your Taste" section now displays book metadata correctly
- Duration values now display properly

### Files Modified
- `src/shared/utils/metadata.ts` - Removed `isBookMedia` dependency from `getMetadata()`
- `src/features/browse/components/TasteTextList.tsx` - Fixed `getBookMetadata()` and `getBookDuration()`
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Use full library cache for book list
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.351

## [0.6.334] - 2026-01-11

### Changed - Candle Animation for Pull-to-Refresh

Replaced the skull animation with a candle animation for pull-to-refresh indicators:

**Visual Changes:**
- **Candle holder** - Decorative holder in theme text color
- **Animated flame** - 14-frame red flame animation at 24fps
- Matches the existing candle loading animation used elsewhere in the app

**Technical:**
- Uses same animation data as `CandleAnimation` in `Loading.tsx`
- Flame rendered behind holder for proper layering
- Removed unused `G` (group) import from react-native-svg

### Files Modified
- `src/shared/components/SkullRefreshControl.tsx` - Replaced skull with candle animation
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.334

---

## [0.6.333] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed - Pull-to-Refresh Double Skull and Background

Fixed visual issues with pull-to-refresh on the book detail screen:

**Problems Fixed:**
- **Double skull icon** - Removed duplicate `refreshOverlay` that was showing a second Loading indicator on top of the SkullRefreshControl
- **Weird background color** - Added proper background color (`#F5F5F0` / creamGray) to the SkullRefreshControl indicator container

**Root Cause:**
The book detail screen had TWO refresh indicators:
1. A `refreshOverlay` View with `<Loading>` component
2. The `SkullRefreshControl` with its own skull animation

Both were showing at once, causing the stacked/doubled appearance.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Removed duplicate refresh overlay
- `src/shared/components/SkullRefreshControl.tsx` - Added background color to indicator
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.333

---

## [0.6.330] - 2026-01-11

### Added - Genre-Based Typography on Player Screen

The player screen now uses the same genre-based typography system as the book detail and spine components:

**Features:**
- Title and author text use dynamic font family based on book genre
- Thrillers show bold sans-serif with uppercase
- Romance shows elegant italic serif
- Fantasy shows classic serif
- Author name always displays in italic variant of the chosen font family

**Implementation:**
- Uses `useSpineCacheStore` to get cached spine data (same as BookDetailScreen)
- Checks for series-locked typography via `getSeriesStyle()` first
- Falls back to `getTypographyForGenres()` for genre-based styling
- Applies text transform (uppercase) for genres that use it

**Typography consistency:**
- Player screen now matches book detail screen typography
- Both use the same cache → same source of truth → same visual result

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/screens/SecretLibraryPlayerScreen.tsx` - Added genre typography
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.330

---

## [0.6.329] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Book Detail Page Audit and Bug Fixes

Multiple fixes from comprehensive audit of the book detail page:

**Bugs Fixed:**
1. **Series navigation broken** - Was passing `{ id }` or `{ name }` but SeriesDetail expects `{ seriesName }`. Now passes correct param.

2. **Can't unmark finished books** - The "Finished" button was disabled when book was marked finished. Now toggleable to unmark.

3. **Title font family mismatch** - Font comparison was checking for `'sans-serif'` but spine calculations return platform-specific values (`'System'` on iOS). Now uses font family value directly.

4. **Chapter duration NaN** - Could produce NaN if chapter start/end were undefined. Now uses nullish coalescing with guard.

**Code Cleanup:**
- Removed dead code: `handleAuthorPress`, `handleNarratorPress` (inline handlers used instead)
- Cleaned up excessive debug logging (wrapped in `__DEV__ && false` toggle)
- Simplified typography code path

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.329

---

## [0.6.328] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Book Detail Title Typography Uses Same Cache as Spine

Fixed font family mismatch by using **only spine cache data** for typography decisions:

**Root cause:** Detail page was falling back to `seriesInfo?.name` from API when `cachedSpineData?.seriesName` was undefined. This caused different code paths:
- Spine: No seriesName in cache → uses genre-based typography → sans-serif
- Detail: Found seriesName in API → uses series typography → random preset (often serif)

**Fix:** Only use `cachedSpineData` values for typography, matching exactly what BookSpineVertical receives:
```typescript
const seriesName = cachedSpineData?.seriesName;  // NOT || seriesInfo?.name
const genres = cachedSpineData?.genres || metadata?.genres || [];
```

Now both spine and detail page follow identical logic and get identical fonts.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.328

---

## [0.6.327] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Book Detail Title Typography Now Matches Spine Exactly

Fixed font family mismatch between book spines and book detail page. The detail page now uses the **exact same logic** as `BookSpineVertical.tsx`:

1. **Series books first:** Check if book has a series name → use `getSeriesStyle(seriesName).typography`
2. **Genre-based fallback:** Non-series books → use `getTypographyForGenres(genres, bookId)`

This ensures "The Left Hand of Darkness" (Sci-Fi) shows sans-serif uppercase on both the spine AND the detail page.

**Before:** Detail page always used genre-based typography, ignoring series
**After:** Detail page checks series first (like spines do), then falls back to genre

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Match spine typography logic exactly
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.327

---

## [0.6.323] - 2026-01-10

### Changed - Use Cached Spine Data for Title Typography

Now pulls genres and series name directly from the spine cache (`cachedSpineData`) instead of extracting from book metadata. This ensures the book detail title styling matches exactly what's shown on the book spine in the shelf view.

**Data flow:**
```
Spine Cache (genres, seriesName) → getTypographyForGenres() → Title styling
```

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.323

---

## [0.6.322] - 2026-01-10

### Changed - Smaller Cover + Spine Typography for Titles

**Cover:** Reduced from 160px to 120px for better proportions

**Title Typography:** Now uses the same genre-based typography system as book spines:
- Fantasy books: Serif font, heavier weight
- Sci-Fi books: Sans-serif, uppercase, wider letter spacing
- Thriller/Crime: Bold sans-serif, uppercase
- Literary: Serif, italic styling
- Children's: Friendly sans-serif
- Series books: Consistent typography across the series

**Implementation:**
- Uses `getTypographyForGenres()` from spine calculations
- Series books use `getSeriesStyle()` for consistency
- Dynamic font family, weight, style, and text transform

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.322

---

## [0.6.321] - 2026-01-10

**Layout:**
```
[ Cover Image ] [ Title, Author, Series ]
[ Duration | Chapters | Narrator | Release Date | Language | Publisher ]

- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.317

---

## [0.6.316] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Downloaded Filter Shows ALL Downloaded Books

**Problem:** When selecting "Downloaded" in the Library screen filter, only downloaded books that were also recently played or recently added were shown. Downloaded books that hadn't been played recently were missing.

**Root Cause:** The filter was applied to `allLibraryItems` which only contained books from `recentlyListened` + `recentlyAdded` lists.

**Solution:** When filter is "Downloaded", use `downloadedLibraryItems` (from complete DownloadTasks with libraryItem) as the data source instead of filtering the limited lists.

**Data Flow:**
```
Filter: "All" / "Not Downloaded" → allLibraryItems (recentlyListened + recentlyAdded)
Filter: "Downloaded" → downloadedLibraryItems (ALL completed downloads)
```

**Result:**
- "Downloaded" filter now shows every downloaded book in your library
- No longer limited to recently played/added books

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Use `effectiveLibraryItems` based on filter mode
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.316

---

## [0.6.310] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Cache ALL In-Progress Books During Init

**Change:** `importRecentProgress()` now processes ALL in-progress books, not just 5.

**Before:**
- Only cached top 5 recently played books during init
- Other in-progress books had to wait for background `importFromServer()`

**After:**
- ALL in-progress books cached during init (before UI shows)
- Every book you've started will show correct progress immediately

**Timing:**
```
App Start → importRecentProgress() → caches ALL in-progress books → UI shows
```

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Remove 5-book limit
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.310

---

## [0.6.309] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Cache Progress for ENTIRE Library

**Change:** `importFromServer()` now caches progress in memory for ALL books, not just recently played.

**Details:**
- Removed limit on library items fetch (was 1000, now unlimited)
- Every book with progress gets cached in `playbackCache`
- Book detail screens read from memory cache first (instant)

**Result:**
- All 2500+ books show correct progress immediately
- No need to hit play first
- Works for any book in the library

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Cache all books, remove limit
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.309

---

## [0.6.308] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - All Recently Played Books Show Correct Progress

**Problem:** Only the most recently played book showed correct progress. Other books in top 5 still showed 0%.

**Solution:** Book detail screens now read from `playbackCache.getProgress()` as a fallback.

**Progress priority order:**
1. Player state (if this book is currently loaded)
2. Memory cache (`playbackCache`) - populated for top 5 books during app startup
3. Local SQLite
4. Spine cache
5. Server progress

**Result:**
- Book #1 (most recent): Shows correct progress via player state
- Books #2-5: Show correct progress via memory cache
- All other books: Fall back to SQLite → spine cache → server

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Add playbackCache fallback
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/BookDetailScreen.tsx` - Add playbackCache fallback
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.308

---

## [0.6.307] - 2026-01-10

### Added - Preload Book State for Correct UI Progress

**Problem:** Book detail screen showed 0% progress until user hit play, even though spine showed correct value (38%).

**Solution:** Preload the most recently played book into the player store during app startup.

**New function: `preloadBookState()`** in playerStore:
- Sets `currentBook`, `position`, `duration`, `chapters` from cached data
- Does NOT start audio playback
- Does NOT show the player UI
- Book detail screen now reads from player state and shows correct progress

**Flow:**
```
App Startup
    ↓
syncFinishedBooks() (background)
    ↓
preloadMostRecentBook()
    ↓
playerStore.preloadBookState(book)
    ↓
Sets: currentBook, position=9120s, duration=29880s
    ↓
Book detail screen shows: 38% (reads from player state)
```

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Add `preloadBookState()` function
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Add `preloadMostRecentBook()` function
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Call preloadMostRecentBook on startup
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.307

---

## [0.6.306] - 2026-01-10

### Added - Instant Playback with Full Caching

**Three-level caching system for instant resume:**

1. **Audio Pre-initialization** (`appInitializer.preInitAudio`)
   - Audio system initialized during app startup (parallel with other init tasks)
   - Eliminates ~200-500ms audio setup delay when hitting play
   - `playbackCache.isAudioInitialized()` tracks state

2. **In-Memory Progress Cache** (`playbackCache.ts`)
   - Progress data cached in memory during `importRecentProgress()`
   - `progressService.getProgressData()` checks memory cache first (instant)
   - Falls back to SQLite only if not cached

3. **Session Pre-fetching** (`finishedBooksSync.prefetchSessions`)
   - Pre-fetches playback sessions for top 5 recently played books
   - Caches audio track URLs, chapters, and metadata
   - Sessions expire after 5 minutes to stay fresh
   - `playerStore` uses cached sessions to skip network call entirely

**Flow on app startup:**
```
Parallel Init:
├── loadFonts()
├── restoreSession()
├── syncRecentProgress() → populates SQLite + memory cache
└── preInitAudio() → audio system ready

Background (after UI shows):
├── prefetchSessions() → sessions ready for top 5 books
└── fullSync() → remaining books
```

**Result when hitting play:**
- Audio system: Already initialized (no delay)
- Progress data: In memory cache (instant, no SQLite read)
- Session data: Pre-fetched (no network call for recent books)
- **Total time to first audio: Near-instant**

### Files Created
- `src/core/services/playbackCache.ts` - In-memory cache for progress and sessions

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Add preInitAudio, prefetchSessions
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Add prefetchSessions, populate memory cache
- `src/features/player/services/progressService.ts` - Check memory cache first
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Use cached sessions

## [0.6.305] - 2026-01-10

### Added - Fast Progress Sync on App Startup

**appInitializer:**
- Added `syncRecentProgress()` to parallel initialization phase
- Syncs top 5 recently played books from server DURING app startup (not after)
- Progress is now available immediately when app becomes interactive

**finishedBooksSync:**
- New `importRecentProgress()` function that:
  - Fetches recently played books via `getItemsInProgress()` API
  - Syncs only top 5 for speed
  - Writes to BOTH `playback_progress` (player) and `user_books` (book detail)
  - Updates spine cache for book spines

**Result:**
- Progress loads during splash screen, not after
- No more lag when hitting play - player starts at correct position immediately
- Book detail, book spines, and player all show same value on first load

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/appInitializer.ts` - Add syncRecentProgress to parallel init
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - New importRecentProgress function
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.305

---

## [0.6.304] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Player Now Uses Pre-loaded Progress

**finishedBooksSync:**
- Now writes to BOTH `playback_progress` table (player reads from) AND `user_books` table
- Previously only wrote to `user_books`, but player reads from `playback_progress`
- Player will now start at correct position immediately without loading delay

**Result:**
- Spine shows 38% ✓
- Book detail shows 38% ✓ (reads from user_books + spine cache)
- Player starts at Chapter 32 immediately ✓ (reads from playback_progress)

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Write to playback_progress table
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.304

---

## [0.6.303] - 2026-01-10

**finishedBooksSync:**
- Now imports progress (not just finished status) from server on app startup
- Saves server progress to SQLite so it's available immediately
- Updates spine cache so book spines show correct progress
- Only imports if server progress is more recent than local

**Result:**
- Book detail page now shows correct progress without needing to play first
- Book spines on home page match detail page progress
- Progress available immediately after app launch

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Import progress and update spine cache
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.303

---

## [0.6.302] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Progress Uses Live Player State

**SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen:**
- Progress now uses live player state when book is currently loaded
- If book is playing (02:32:47), detail page shows that position immediately
- Fallback order: player state → local SQLite → spine cache → server
- Duration showing correctly (8h 18m)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Use player position for progress
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.302

---

## [0.6.301] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Progress Now Uses Spine Cache

---

## [0.6.300] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Duration Now Uses Spine Cache

**SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen:**
- Duration now uses spine cache as primary source (same as book spines on home page)
- This ensures the book detail page shows the same duration as the book spine
- Fallback order: spine cache → media.duration → audioFiles sum → last chapter end

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Use spine cache for duration
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.300

---

## [0.6.299] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Duration Display (Additional Fallback)

**SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen:**
- Added third fallback for duration: uses last chapter's end time
- Duration calculation now tries: media.duration → audioFiles sum → last chapter end time
- This matches how the book spine calculates duration from chapters data

---

## [0.6.298] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Duration Display

**SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen:**
- Fixed duration showing "0m" when `media.duration` is not set

### Fixed - Progress Bar Accuracy (SQLite Single Source of Truth)

**BookDetailScreen.tsx:**
- Progress bar now uses SQLite as single source of truth (via `useBookProgress` hook)
- Prefers local SQLite progress over server-reported progress
- Chapter position tracking also prefers local SQLite time
- Consistent with SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen behavior

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/BookDetailScreen.tsx` - Added useBookProgress hook, updated progress calculations
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.6.296

## [0.6.292] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed - Header Overlap Issue

Fixed the header overlapping tabs on author/narrator detail screens.

**Root Cause:**
- Header was `position: absolute` inside the ScrollView
- For long names (like "Ursula K. Le Guin"), header height exceeded the fixed paddingTop
- This caused the stats text and header content to overlap the tabs

**Fix:**
- Removed `position: absolute` from header - now part of normal scroll flow
- Header naturally takes as much space as needed for the name
- Reduced paddingTop from 60px to 16px (just for safe area)
- Tabs and toggle now render below header without overlap

### Files Modified
- `src/features/author/screens/SecretLibraryAuthorDetailScreen.tsx` - Fixed header layout
- `src/features/narrator/screens/SecretLibraryNarratorDetailScreen.tsx` - Fixed header layout

## [0.6.278] - 2026-01-09

### Added - Enhanced Typography System

Incrementally expanded the book spine typography system with new properties for finer control over text styling.

**New SpineTypography Properties:**
- `letterSpacing: number` - Letter spacing in em units (0 = normal, positive = wide tracking)
- `authorOrientationBias: 'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'neutral'` - Hint for solver when authorPosition is 'auto'
- `contrast: 'high' | 'normal'` - High contrast increases title/author size difference
- `titleWeight: string` - Override weight for title only (defaults to fontWeight)
- `authorWeight: string` - Override weight for author only (defaults to fontWeight)

**Genre Typography Updates:**
- All existing genres now have `letterSpacing`, `authorOrientationBias`, `contrast` values
- Added new genre presets: `classics`, `memoir`, `adventure`, `humor`, `western`, `philosophy`, `science`, `psychology`
- Horror gets widest tracking (0.08em) and max weight (900) for impact
- Sci-fi gets futuristic wide tracking (0.06em)
- Literary/poetry get elegant slight spacing (0.02-0.03em)
- Non-fiction/biography genres use prominent author weights for authority

**Rendering Changes:**
- Title text now applies `titleWeight`, `contrast` multiplier (1.05x for high contrast), and `letterSpacing`
- Author text applies `authorWeight`, inverse contrast (0.92x for high contrast), and half letterSpacing
- `authorOrientationBias` now influences layout solver's horizontal preference

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Added new types and properties to SpineTypography, updated all genre presets
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Applied new typography properties to text rendering
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.276] - 2026-01-09

### Added - SVG Text Length Scaling

Added `textLength` and `lengthAdjust` props to all spine text elements for perfect text fitting.

**How it works:**
- SVG's `textLength` prop specifies the exact length text should occupy
- `lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs"` scales both letter spacing and glyph widths to fit
- Text is guaranteed to fit within bounds without clipping

**Values used:**
- Title (vertical): `(titleHeight - INNER_MARGIN * 2) * 0.92` - 92% of available height
- Title (horizontal): `(titleBoxWidth) * 0.90` - 90% of available width
- Author (vertical): `(authorHeight - INNER_MARGIN * 2) * 0.92` - 92% of available height
- Author (horizontal): `(authorBoxWidth) * 0.90` - 90% of available width

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Added textLength and lengthAdjust to SvgText elements
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.275] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Spine Text Coordinate Translation

Fixed misalignment issues with multi-line vertical text on book spines (e.g., "URSULA K." and "LE GUIN" appearing at different positions).

**Problem:**
- The layout solver calculates text positions relative to a "box" (0,0 at top-left of box)
- When translating back to SVG coordinates, the Y offset was using inconsistent calculations
- Title used `titleY + (titleHeight * 0.05)` but box was constructed with `titleHeight - INNER_MARGIN*2`
- Author used `authorY + (authorHeight * 0.05)` but box started at `authorY + INNER_MARGIN`
- This mismatch caused multi-line text to appear offset or misaligned

**Solution:**
1. **Consistent Coordinate Translation** - Both title and author now use:
   - Box origin X: `EDGE_PADDING + INNER_MARGIN`
   - Box origin Y: `sectionY + INNER_MARGIN`
   - Adjusted position: `boxOrigin + line.position` (from solver)

2. **Per-Section Clip Paths** - Added safety net clip paths for each section:
   - `title-clip-{bookId}` - Clips title text to title section bounds
   - `author-clip-{bookId}` - Clips author text to author section bounds
   - Prevents any text overflow between sections

3. **Debug Visualization** - Added optional debug mode (`DEBUG_SECTIONS = true`) that shows:
   - Section boundaries (author=blue, title=green, progress=red)
   - Solver box boundaries (dashed lines)
   - Useful for diagnosing layout issues

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Fixed coordinate translation, added per-section clip paths, added debug visualization
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.269] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Author Box Layout Preference

Fixed issue where author boxes weren't appearing because the layout solver always preferred vertical text.

**Problem:**
- For narrow spines (~35-45px), vertical text allows larger fonts than horizontal
- The solver was always choosing vertical, even for thriller/crime genres that want boxes
- Boxes only work with horizontal layouts, so they never appeared

**Solution:**
1. Added `preferHorizontal` parameter to `solveAuthorLayout()`
2. When `typography.authorBox` is `'horizontal-only'` or `'always'`, the solver gets a +25 point bonus for horizontal layouts
3. This overcomes vertical's font size advantage for genres that want author boxes

**Also Fixed:**
- Corrected author box coordinate calculation (was using wrong x offset)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/layoutSolver.ts` - Added preferHorizontal to LayoutContext and scoring
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Pass preferHorizontal based on typography, fix box coordinates
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.268] - 2026-01-09

### Added - Author Box Styling for Commercial Genres

Added optional rectangular boxes around author names on book spines. This gives a distinctive "commercial fiction" look to thrillers, business books, and non-fiction titles while keeping literary and romance spines elegant and unframed.

**Features:**

1. **Genre-Based Box Preference** - Added `authorBox` property to typography profiles:
   - `'horizontal-only'`: Show box when author is horizontal (thriller, crime, business, biography, history, self-help)
   - `'never'`: Never show box (literary, romance, poetry, fantasy, horror, children's)

2. **Box Style Variants** - Three visual styles based on genre/tags:
   - `minimal`: Thin stroke (0.5px), subtle gray (#666), used for business/self-help
   - `classic`: Medium stroke (0.75px), darker gray (#444), used for thriller/crime
   - `bold`: Thick stroke (1.5px), dark (#333), used for noir/police-procedural

3. **Tag Override System**:
   - Tags that force boxes: `thriller`, `crime`, `noir`, `bestseller`, `history`, `biography`
   - Tags that prevent boxes: `literary-fiction`, `poetry`, `gothic`, `cozy`, `romance`, `award-winner`

4. **Layout Bounds Tracking** - Updated layout solver to compute bounds for horizontal text, used for box positioning

**Visual Examples:**
```
THRILLER (with box):        LITERARY FICTION (no box):
┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐
│ ┌──────────┐ │           │  Donna       │
│ │  MICK    │ │           │  Tartt       │
│ │ HERRON   │ │           │              │
│ └──────────┘ │           │ The Secret   │
│  SLOW        │           │  History     │
│  HORSES      │           └──────────────┘
└──────────────┘
```

## [0.6.267] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Book Spine Layout Solver for Short Titles

Fixed an issue where short titles like "Scarlet Feather" would appear with tiny, boring text instead of filling the available space with large, bold text.

**Problem:**
- For a 2-word title on a narrow spine, the layout solver would split it into 2 vertical columns
- Each column only got half the spine width, resulting in ~15px fonts
- A single vertical line would allow ~34px fonts but wasn't being chosen

**Root Cause:**
- The efficiency scoring penalized high fill ratios (>70%) as "overfilling"
- For short titles, we actually WANT to fill the space with big text
- No direct scoring component rewarded larger font sizes

**Solution:**
1. **Updated `scoreEfficiency`** - For short text (<20 chars), high fill ratios now score higher:
   - <10% fill: 20 (bad - text is tiny)
   - 10-20%: 40
   - 20-35%: 60
   - 35-50%: 80
   - >50%: 100 (great - fills the space!)

2. **Added `scoreFontSizeMaximization`** (20% weight) - Directly rewards larger fonts:
   - Short titles (<15 chars): 28px+ → 100, 22px+ → 85, etc.
   - Medium titles (<25 chars): 20px+ → 100
   - Longer titles: more lenient thresholds

3. **Rebalanced scoring weights:**
   - readability: 30% → 25%
   - balance: 20% → 15%
   - aesthetics: 15% → 10%
   - fontMaximization: NEW 20%
   - splitScore: 20% → 15%

**Result:** Short titles now display with large, impactful fonts that fill the available vertical space.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/layoutSolver.ts` - Updated efficiency scoring, added font maximization
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.266] - 2026-01-09

### Added - Genre-Based Book Spine Dimension System

Implemented a comprehensive genre-based dimension calculation system for book spines. Book spine heights and widths are now dynamically calculated based on:

**Genre Profiles (50+ genres):**
- Children's books (0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12) - progressively taller, playful personality
- Teen/YA - standard dimensions
- Literary Fiction, Classics - tall and elegant
- Fantasy, Sci-Fi - imposing dimensions, wide range based on duration
- Mystery, Thriller, Crime - standard to chunky
- Romance - compact personality
- Non-Fiction categories (Biography, History, Self-Help, etc.)
- Short form (Essays, Short Stories) - elegant and thin

**Tag Modifiers (80+ tags):**
- Subgenre tags: epic-fantasy (+15% height, +20% width), cozy-fantasy (-12%), grimdark (+10%)
- Era tags: victorian, medieval, regency - affect dimensions
- Creature tags: dragons, vampires, fae - flavor adjustments
- Vibe tags: atmospheric, fast-paced, emotional
- Duration overrides: under-5-hours, over-20-hours

**Personality System:**
- `imposing` - tall, wide (epics, histories)
- `elegant` - tall, thin (literary, gothic)
- `chunky` - medium height, thick (crime, anthologies)
- `compact` - shorter, standard width (romance, self-help)
- `playful` - variable, fun proportions (children's, humor)
- `standard` - balanced dimensions

**Series Consistency:**
- Books in the same series share identical height
- Width varies based on individual book duration
- First book in series sets the style for all others

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Added GENRE_PROFILES, TAG_MODIFIERS, calculateBookDimensions()
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Added tags support, use new dimension calculation
- `src/features/home/components/BookshelfView.tsx` - Use genre-based dimension calculation
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Pass tags from metadata to spine data

## [0.6.262] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Title Layout on Narrow Spines

Fixed issue where long titles on narrow spines were being clipped horizontally (showing only the middle portion of text like "True Sto" / "ree Litt" instead of the full title).

#### Layout Solver Improvements
1. **More Conservative Horizontal Layout**: Reduced available length from 88% to 75% for horizontal orientation to prevent text overflow
2. **Heavy Penalty for Horizontal on Narrow Spines**:
   - Spines < 50px with text > 15 chars: -40 score
   - Spines < 45px with text > 10 chars: -30 score
   - Spines < 60px with text > 25 chars: -35 score
3. **Stronger Vertical Preference**: Narrow spines (< 50px) now get +20 bonus for vertical orientation
4. **Better Aspect Ratio Handling**: Tall spines (aspect > 8) get extra +10 for vertical

### Changed - Library Screen View Modes

Simplified the Library screen from 3 view modes to 2:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| List, Grid, Book | Book (primary), Grid (secondary) |

- **Removed List View**: Eliminated list view and all related components/styles
- **Book Spine as Default**: Bookshelf view is now the primary/default view mode
- **Cleaner Toggle**: View toggle now shows only Book and Grid icons

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/layoutSolver.ts` - Conservative horizontal estimates, stronger vertical preference
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Removed list view, reordered toggle

---

## [0.6.261] - 2026-01-09

### Major Refactor - Unified Layout Solver

Replaced hardcoded layout rules with a systematic constraint satisfaction solver
that generalizes across all book titles, author names, and spine dimensions.

#### New File: `layoutSolver.ts`

A unified text layout solver implementing 8 key principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Constraint Satisfaction | Define hard/soft constraints, find solutions that satisfy them |
| Continuous Parameter Space | Explore all combinations: 1/2/3 lines × horizontal/vertical |
| Scored Split Generation | Score ALL possible split points, not just middle |
| Font Size as Derived | Binary search for largest font that fits constraints |
| Unified Scoring | Single function scores readability, balance, efficiency, aesthetics |
| Cascading Fallbacks | Abbreviation → relaxed constraints → truncation |
| Flexible Allocation | Section sizes adapt to content needs |
| Deterministic Variation | Hash-based nudges for organic variety |

#### Smart Split Scoring

The solver scores every possible split point based on:
- **Balance** (0-30 pts): Similar line lengths preferred
- **Orphans** (-25 pts): Never end lines with "and", "the", "of", etc.
- **Widows** (-20 pts): Final lines < 4 chars penalized
- **Semantic Breaks** (+20 pts): Bonus for splitting at `:`, `-`, etc.
- **Series Patterns** (-30 pts): Never split "Vol. 1", "Book 2", etc.
- **Title Patterns** (+15 pts): Known good splits like "Harry Potter" / "Chamber of Secrets"

#### Example Improvements

| Title | Old Split | New Split |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets | "Harry Potter and the" / "Chamber of Secrets" | "Harry Potter" / "Chamber of Secrets" |
| The True Story of the Three Little Pigs | Cramped 2 lines | Clean 3 lines |

#### Fallback Cascade

1. **Tier 1**: Full text with optimal layout
2. **Tier 2**: Smart abbreviations (remove articles, subtitles, initials)
3. **Tier 3**: Relaxed constraints (allow 7px instead of 8px)
4. **Tier 4**: Truncation with ellipsis
5. **Tier 5**: Clip (last resort)

### Files Added
- `src/features/home/utils/layoutSolver.ts`

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Now uses unified solver
- `src/features/home/utils/authorLayoutStrategy.ts` - Kept for reference (deprecated)

## [0.6.260] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Horizontal-Stacked Author Centering

Fixed spacing issue where horizontal-stacked author text was positioned too low with empty space at the top.

#### Changes
1. **Rewrote y-position calculation** in `tryHorizontalStacked`:
   - First pass calculates font sizes for all lines
   - Second pass calculates y positions based on actual font sizes used
   - Properly centers text block within the box
   - Uses explicit 4px gap between lines

2. **Fixed rendering offset** in `BookSpineVertical`:
   - Added 5% offset to center the 90% strategy box within full author section

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/authorLayoutStrategy.ts`
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx`

---

## [0.6.259] - 2026-01-09

### Added - Multi-Strategy Author Layout System

Implemented a sophisticated layout strategy selector for author names that tries multiple
approaches and picks the best one.

#### New File: `authorLayoutStrategy.ts`
Standalone module for smart author layout selection.

#### Four Layout Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `horizontal-single` | Single horizontal line | Short names, wide spines |
| `horizontal-stacked` | 2-3 horizontal lines stacked | Medium names, wider spines |
| `vertical-single` | Single rotated line (-90°) | Any name, tall narrow spines |
| `vertical-split` | 2-3 rotated columns side-by-side | Long names, narrow spines |

#### How It Works
1. Tries all 4 strategies with current box dimensions
2. Each strategy reports if it "fits" (font size >= minimum)
3. Fitting strategies are scored based on:
   - Font size (larger = better)
   - Aspect ratio match (tall spines prefer vertical)
   - Name characteristics (length, word count)
4. Best scoring strategy is selected
5. Fallback: abbreviated name ("U. Le Guin") or initials ("U.L.G.")

#### Scoring Logic
- **Horizontal-single**: Bonus for readable fonts (9-12px ideal range)
- **Horizontal-stacked**: Prefers balanced line lengths
- **Vertical-single**: Loves tall narrow spines (aspect > 6)
- **Vertical-split**: Last resort, good for very tall spines with long names

#### Author Name Parsing
Smart parsing handles:
- "Ursula K. Le Guin" → ["Ursula K.", "Le Guin"]
- "George Raymond Richard Martin" → ["George R.R.", "Martin"] or 3 lines
- Compound surnames: van, von, de, le, mc, mac, o', etc.

### Files Added
- `src/features/home/utils/authorLayoutStrategy.ts`

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Now uses `selectAuthorLayout()`

## [0.6.258] - 2026-01-09

### Changed - Taller Book Spines

Increased all book heights by ~30px for better visual presence.

| Dimension | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| BASE_HEIGHT | 320 | 350 |
| MIN_HEIGHT | 260 | 290 |
| MAX_HEIGHT | 420 | 450 |

### Files Modified

## [0.6.257] - 2026-01-09

### Major Refactor - Comprehensive Logic Improvements

This version addresses critical gaps identified in code review, adding explicit fallbacks,
better algorithms, and accessibility compliance.

#### 1. Explicit Fallback Cascade
Every calculation now has explicit fallbacks for missing data:
- **Missing duration**: Uses median width (42px)
- **Missing genres**: Deterministic random typography from book ID
- **Missing author**: Empty string handling
- **Missing bookId**: Uses 'default' for hash

#### 2. Series Registry with Locking
- **Normalized names**: "The Lord of the Rings" → "lord of the rings"
- **Locked heights**: Once created, series height cannot change
- **Consistent matching**: Handles article variations automatically

#### 3. Logarithmic Width Calculation
```typescript
// Old: Linear segments
// New: Logarithmic scaling with diminishing returns
const logRatio = Math.log(1 + ratio * 9) / Math.log(10);
width = MIN_WIDTH + (MAX_WIDTH - MIN_WIDTH) * logRatio;
```
- 1 hour → 32px
- 5 hours → 44px
- 10 hours → 52px
- 20 hours → 62px
- 30 hours → 70px (capped)

#### 4. Compound Surname Handling
New `parseAuthorName()` function handles particles correctly:
- "Ursula K. Le Guin" → "Ursula K." / "Le Guin"
- "Vincent van Gogh" → "Vincent" / "van Gogh"
- "J.R.R. Tolkien" → "J.R.R." / "Tolkien"

Particles recognized: van, von, de, du, del, della, di, da, le, la, mc, mac, o', etc.

#### 5. Linguistic Title Splitting
New `findBestTitleSplit()` with scoring system:
- **Bonus**: Breaking after articles/prepositions (the, of, in, etc.)
- **Penalty**: Breaking before "Vol. 1", "Book 2", "#3"
- **Penalty**: Very unbalanced splits (<30% ratio)

#### 6. Touch Target Compliance (44px minimum)
- New `calculateTouchPadding()` function
- `hitSlop` added to pressable for narrow spines
- Narrow 28px spine gets 8px padding each side

#### 7. Genre Priority System
Genres now have explicit priority order (most specific first):
1. Mystery/Thriller/Crime
2. Horror
3. Romance
4. Sci-Fi
5. Fantasy
6. Children's
... (12 categories total)

#### 8. Performance Caching
- Font size calculations cached (500 entry limit)
- Series styles locked after creation
- Hash function optimized (djb2 variant)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Integration updates

---

## [0.6.256] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Smarter Title Split Logic

#### Dynamic Minimum Font Based on Spine Width
- **Narrow spines (28px)**: min font ~10px (smaller acceptable)
- **Wide spines (70px)**: min font ~16px (larger minimum)
- Formula: `dynamicMinFont = clamp(10, width × 0.22, 16)`

#### Title Split Decision Logic
```
NEVER SPLIT when:
  • Title ≤6 chars (too short, looks bad split)

SPLIT when:
  • Very long (>25 chars) AND font too small
  • Narrow spine (<40px) AND title >12 chars AND font borderline
  • Font too small AND title >10 chars
  • Wide tall spine: only if title >15 chars AND font <90% of min
```

#### Adaptive Line Width for Splits
- **Narrow spines (<40px)**: 46% per line (tighter packing)
- **Medium spines (40-50px)**: 44% per line
- **Wide spines (>50px)**: 42% per line (more gap between lines)

#### Examples
| Title | Width | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "It" | 35px | Single line (too short to split) |
| "The Phantom Tollbooth" | 48px | Single line (fits well) |
| "The Left Hand of Darkness" | 38px | Split (narrow + long) |
| "A Very Long Title Indeed" | 60px | Single line (wide spine) |

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Title split logic

---

## [0.6.255] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Smarter Author Orientation with Aspect Ratio

#### New Aspect Ratio-Based Logic
The author orientation now considers the spine's **aspect ratio** (height/width), not just width:

**ALWAYS VERTICAL when:**
- Single word author (can't split)
- Narrow spine (width < 45px)
- Very tall spine (aspect ratio > 6)
- Tall spine (aspect ratio > 5) with name > 10 chars

**ALLOW HORIZONTAL only when:**
- Short name (≤10 chars) + wide (≥50px) + not too tall (ratio < 5)
- Medium name (≤14 chars) + wider (≥55px) + well-proportioned (ratio < 4.5)
- Longer name (≤18 chars) + very wide (≥60px) + short spine (ratio < 4)

**DEFAULT: VERTICAL** (safer choice)

#### Why This Matters
- "Norton Juster" on tall Phantom Tollbooth → now VERTICAL (was horizontal)
- "Ursula K. Le Guin" on narrow spine → now VERTICAL (was trying horizontal)
- Horizontal only used when spine is wide AND short enough

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Aspect ratio logic

---

## [0.6.254] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Line-by-Line Author Scaling & Better Margins

#### Line-by-Line Horizontal Author Scaling
- **Each line scales independently**: "Ursula" fills width, "K. Le Guin" fills width (different sizes)
- **Two separate SvgText elements**: Enables independent font sizes per line
- **Better visual balance**: First names and last names each maximize their space

#### New Spacing Constants
- **INNER_MARGIN = 4px**: Safety margin inside spine to prevent clipping
- **SECTION_GAP = 2px**: Gap between author/title/progress sections
- **HORIZONTAL_LINE_GAP = 2px**: Gap between horizontal author lines

#### Improved Margin Logic
- **Title height with margins**: `safeHeight = titleHeight - (INNER_MARGIN * 2)`
- **Author width with margins**: `textWidth = availableWidth - (INNER_MARGIN * 2)`
- **Section positions include gaps**: Cleaner separation between sections

#### Updated Constants
- `TITLE_LINE_SPACING = 0.52` (tighter, was 0.55)
- `AUTHOR_LINE_SPACING = 0.55` (tighter, was 0.6)
- `MAX_AUTHOR_FONT = 16` (was 14)
- `MIN_TITLE_FONT_FOR_SPLIT = 14` (was 16)
- `AUTHOR_PERCENT_BASE = 22%` (was 20%)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Line-by-line scaling, margins, spacing

---

## [0.6.253] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Duration-Based Width & Author Orientation

#### Restored Duration-Based Spine Width
- **Width varies by audiobook length**: Longer books = thicker spines
- **4 tiers based on hours**:
  - Short (<4 hrs): 28-36px
  - Medium (4-10 hrs): 36-48px
  - Long (10-20 hrs): 48-58px
  - Epic (>20 hrs): 58-70px
- **Visual comparison**: Users can compare book lengths at a glance

#### Fixed Author Orientation
- **Short names (≤14 chars)**: Now horizontal (easier to read)
- **Medium names (15-20 chars)**: Horizontal on wider spines (≥42px)
- **Long names (>20 chars)**: Vertical (fits better)
- **Single word authors**: Always vertical (can't split into 2 lines)
- **Very narrow spines (<36px)**: Always vertical

#### Fixed Line Spacing
- **AUTHOR_LINE_SPACING = 0.6**: Used for split author names (was hardcoded 0.7)
- **TITLE_LINE_SPACING = 0.55**: Tighter spacing for split titles

#### Fixed Author/Title Overlap
- **MAX_AUTHOR_FONT = 14**: Caps author font to prevent overlap with title
- **MIN_AUTHOR_FONT = 9**: Ensures readability
- **Author section = 20%**: Reduced to give title more room

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Duration-based width calculation
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Author orientation logic, line spacing

---

## [0.6.252] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Bigger Text, More Top Padding

#### More Top Padding (Visible Gap)
- **TOP_PADDING increased to 16px** (was 10px) - clear visible gap at top of spine
- **Separate BOTTOM_PADDING = 8px** - different top/bottom padding for better balance
- Text no longer touches the top edge

#### Bigger Title Text
- **Fill factor: 0.92** (was 0.88) - titles fill more of the available space
- **Thickness: 0.95** (was 0.90) - allows thicker/taller text
- ClipPath prevents any overflow

#### Bigger Author Text
- **Author multiplier: 0.92x** (was 0.85x) - almost as large as title
- **Section space: 24%** (was 22%) - more room for author
- **MIN_AUTHOR_FONT = 11** (was 10) - larger minimum

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - TOP_PADDING=16, BOTTOM_PADDING=8, section %
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - fill=0.92, thickness=0.95, author=0.92x

---

## [0.6.251] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Consistent Width, Better Padding, Bigger Author

#### Consistent Spine Width
- **Fixed width for all books**: All spines are now 48px wide (was variable based on duration)
- **Compare by height**: Users can now compare book lengths at a glance by HEIGHT
- **Cleaner shelf appearance**: Uniform width creates a tidier bookshelf

#### Better Padding & Margins
- **Edge padding increased**: 8px from edges (was 5px) - titles don't get too close to edges
- **Top padding increased**: 10px (was 8px) - more breathing room

#### Bigger Author Text
- **Font multiplier increased**: 0.85x of title size (was 0.7x) - much more readable
- **More section space**: Author gets 22% of spine (was 16%)
- **Prefer single line**: Only split author names >18 chars (was >10)
- **Names like "Susanna Clarke" now fit on one line**

#### Technical Changes
- `calculateSpineWidth()` now returns fixed 48px
- `EDGE_PADDING = 8`, `TOP_PADDING = 10`
- `MIN_AUTHOR_FONT = 10` (was 8)
- `AUTHOR_PERCENT_BASE = 22` (was 16)
- Author split threshold: 18 chars (was 10)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Fixed width, bigger author multiplier
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Better padding, author sizing

---

## [0.6.250] - 2026-01-09

### Changed - Moved Series Info from Spines to Book Detail

#### Book Spines (Simplified)
- **Removed series info**: No longer displays "Series Name #N" on book spines
- **Cleaner layout**: Simple 3-section layout (Author → Title → Progress)
- **More title space**: Title section now 74% (was 64% + 10% series)
- **Title centered**: No more conditional positioning for series

#### Book Detail Screen (Added Series)
- **Series info added**: Shows series name and book number below author
- **Smart extraction**: Handles both array format (`metadata.series[0]`) and string format (`seriesName #N`)
- **Italic styling**: Series displayed in italic to differentiate from author
- **Conditional**: Only shows when book is part of a series

#### Visual Layout (Book Detail)
```
Title
Author Name
Series Name #3    ← New (only if in series)
Duration  Chapters
```

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Removed all series display code
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/SecretLibraryBookDetailScreen.tsx` - Added series info display

---

## [0.6.249] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Series Position Right Next to Title

#### Dynamic Series Positioning
- **4px gap**: Series now positioned exactly 4px to the left of title (not a fixed percentage)
- **Font-size aware**: Position calculated based on actual font sizes:
  - `seriesCenterX = titleCenterX - titleFontSize/2 - 4 - seriesInfoFontSize/2`
- **Title at 60%**: Shifted slightly more to the right to make room
- **Aligned pair**: Series and title now appear as a cohesive pair, not separate elements

#### Technical Changes
- Moved seriesCenterX calculation after font sizes are computed
- Added `SERIES_TITLE_GAP = 4` constant for the gap between series and title
- Title position: `width * 0.60` when series present (was 0.58)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Dynamic series positioning

---

## [0.6.248] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Text Overflow on Long Titles

#### Overflow Prevention
- **Reduced fill factors**: Length fill reduced from 98% to 88%, thickness from 95% to 90%
- **Added SVG clipPath**: All text content wrapped in clipped group to prevent overflow
- **Long titles safe**: "THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS" and similar long titles now stay within spine bounds

#### Technical Changes
- Added `Defs` and `ClipPath` imports from react-native-svg
- Created `spine-clip-{bookId}` clipPath matching spine shape
- Wrapped all text (title, author, series, progress) in `<G clipPath="...">`
- Font calculation now uses 0.88 length factor (was 0.98) for safety

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - Safer fill factors
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - ClipPath to prevent overflow

---

## [0.6.247] - 2026-01-09

---

## [0.6.246] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Larger Title & Closer Series (Matching Reference Image 73)

#### Title Size - Aggressive Fill
- **Removed conservative multipliers**: Font calculation now uses 98% length fill (was 81%)
- **Larger thickness allowance**: 95% of width (was 72%)
- **No double-padding**: Removed redundant 0.9/0.92 multipliers from caller
- **Result**: Title text is now MUCH larger, filling the spine like reference

#### Series Position - Right Next to Title
- **Closer to title**: Series at 22% from left (was 12% - too far)
- **Title at 58%**: Slight shift to make room (was 55%)
- **Gap reduced**: Series and title now appear as a pair, not separate elements

#### Technical Changes
- `calculateFillFontSize()`: 0.98 length fill, 0.95 thickness (was 0.9, 0.85)
- Caller passes full `titleHeight` and `titleAvailableWidth` (no more 0.9/0.92)
- `seriesCenterX = width * 0.22`, `titleCenterX = width * 0.58`

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/utils/spineCalculations.ts` - More aggressive font calculation
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Removed redundant multipliers, adjusted positions

---

## [0.6.245] - 2026-01-09

### Improved - Series Label Positioning (Matching Reference)

#### Visual Changes
- **Series at far left edge**: Series info now positioned at 12% from left (was 22%) - like a margin label
- **Title mostly centered**: Title at 55% from left when series present (was 62%) - takes most of the space
- **Smaller series font**: Max 7px (was 8px) - subtle edge label style
- **More title width**: Title gets 82% of available width when series present (was 65%)

#### Layout Matches Reference
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ S                        │
│ e                        │
│ r  T I T L E             │  ← Series small at edge
│ i                        │    Title large and centered
│ e                        │
│ s                        │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Adjusted positioning constants

## [0.6.244] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Series Books Now Use Genre Typography

#### Typography Fix
- **Genre styling restored**: Series books now use their actual genre-based typography instead of uniform series styling
- **Series consistency preserved**: Series books still share consistent height and icon
- **Visual variety**: A mystery book in a series will now look like a mystery (bold, uppercase) not a generic style

#### What Series Provides Now
- ✅ Consistent **height** across series
- ✅ Consistent **icon** for series identification
- ✅ Series **byline** showing "Series Name #N"
- ❌ NO longer overrides typography (uses book's genre)

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Always use getTypographyForGenres()

---

## [0.6.243] - 2026-01-09

### Changed - Series Info as Byline

#### Series Byline Positioning
- **Series as byline**: Series info ("Series Name #N") now displays as a byline to the LEFT of the title, not in a separate section
- **Same Y position**: Series text shares the title's Y range, running alongside it
- **Visual hierarchy**: Series text is smaller (8px max) and more transparent (50% opacity) to not compete with the title
- **Title shifts right**: When series is present, title moves to 62% from left, making room for series at 22%
- **Title width adjusted**: Title gets 65% of available width when series byline is shown

### Technical Details
- `seriesCenterX = width * 0.22` (left portion)
- `titleCenterX = width * 0.62` when series present (was 50% center)
- Both rotate -90 degrees for vertical reading
- Series font size: `Math.min(width * 0.22, 8)` - small but readable

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - Series byline positioning alongside title

---

## [0.6.242] - 2026-01-09

- **Support both data formats**: Handles `metadata.series[0].sequence` array format AND `metadata.seriesName` string format (e.g., "Series Name #1")
- **New `extractSeriesInfo()` helper**: Centralized series extraction logic matching SeriesNavigator pattern

#### Last Book Lean
- **Last book leans left**: The last book in the shelf now always leans to the left (toward the other books)
- **Single book stays straight**: If there's only one book, it remains upright
- **Consistent behavior**: Last book lean takes priority over random lean distribution

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx` - New extractSeriesInfo() helper
- `src/features/home/components/BookshelfView.tsx` - Last book lean logic

---

## [0.6.240] - 2026-01-09

### Added - Book Spine Improvements & Progress Actions

---

## [0.6.234] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed - Last Played Time Data & Conditional Display

- **Fixed lastPlayedAt data**: Now correctly uses `mediaProgress.lastUpdate` timestamp from API
- **Conditional time display**: Last played time only shows on spines when sorted by "Recent"
- **Fixed sort by recent**: Uses numeric timestamp comparison instead of string date parsing
- **Data type fix**: Changed `lastPlayedAt` from ISO string to Unix timestamp for proper sorting

### Technical Details
- `transformToLibraryBook` now extracts `lastUpdate` from `mediaProgress` or `progressLastUpdate`
- `transformToSpineData` accepts `showLastPlayed` flag, converts timestamp to ISO string only when needed
- Sort comparison simplified to `(b.lastPlayedAt || 0) - (a.lastPlayedAt || 0)`

### Files Modified

---

## [0.6.228] - 2026-01-09

  - Splits at middle word for balanced lines
  - Both lines render as parallel vertical text
- **Multi-line authors**: Long author names split into 2 lines when font would be <9px
  - Same smart split logic at word boundaries

  - Leaning books get extra gap to push neighbors away
- **3px edge padding**: All content now has padding from spine edges
- **Minimum author font**: Set 6px minimum so tiny authors are still readable
- **Improved author orientation thresholds**: Better logic for vertical vs horizontal

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookshelfView.tsx` - Lean logic, nav bar padding
- `src/features/home/components/BookSpineVertical.tsx` - leanAngle prop, edge padding, min font

---

## [0.6.221] - 2026-01-09

### Changed - Bookshelf Horizontal Scroll

- **Horizontal scrolling**: Books now scroll left/right instead of vertical rows
- **Removed tilt**: Books no longer have random tilt angles (prevents overlap)
- **Progress display**: Shows just number (e.g., "42") without % sign, hidden when 0
- **Smart author orientation**: Automatically chooses vertical vs horizontal based on:
  - Single word authors → always vertical
  - Narrow spines (<40px) → always vertical
  - Short names (≤14 chars) on wide spines (≥45px) → horizontal
  - Longer names → vertical

### Files Modified
- `src/features/home/components/BookshelfView.tsx` - Horizontal ScrollView

---

## [0.6.163] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Background Cover Loading (Removed Width)

Removed width parameter from background cover URL - trying without size specification to fix Android loading issue.

---

## [0.6.162] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Background Cover Not Loading on Android

Changed background image source to use `{ uri: ... }` format and set width to 1000px for Android compatibility.

---

## [0.6.161] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Center Down Arrow in Player Header

Made the close button (down arrow) absolutely centered in the player header using `position: 'absolute'`, `left: '50%'`, and `marginLeft: scale(-22)`.

---

## [0.6.160] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Separator On Time Side

Moved the "|" separator from the blue delta text to the time side:
- New `timeSeparator` style with `opacity: 0.4` (lower than time)
- Separator appears between time and delta
- Delta text now just shows "+/-Xm Xs" without the pipe

---

## [0.6.159] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Delta Text Actually Centered

Added `width: scale(120)` to deltaDisplay so `textAlign: 'center'` actually works. Text now centers within the fixed-width container.

---

## [0.6.158] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Center Align Delta Text

Added `textAlign: 'center'` to deltaDisplay style.

---

## [0.6.157] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Animated Horizontal Shift for Time

Time now animates horizontally:
- Not seeking: time is centered (translateX: 0)
- Seeking: time shifts left (translateX: scale(-50)) to visually center time+delta group
- Both shifts animate together with the font size and vertical position changes

---

## [0.6.156] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Visual Centering of Time + Delta

Added `marginLeft: scale(-50)` to timeWrapper to shift the group left, making "00:11:10 | -1m 41s" appear visually centered on screen.

---

## [0.6.155] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Delta Doesn't Shift Time When Value Changes

Added timeWrapper around time text with delta absolutely positioned:
- Time is centered via the wrapper
- Delta uses `position: 'absolute', left: '100%'` to appear right after time
- When delta value changes length ("+30s" vs "+1m 33s"), time position stays stable

---

## [0.6.154] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Time + Delta Centered Together

Changed layout so time and delta are centered as a group:
- Removed absolute positioning from delta - now a flex sibling of time
- Made timeAndDeltaRow an animated view with translateY
- Both elements move up together and are centered as "00:03:12 | +6m 38s"

---

## [0.6.153] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Delta Vertical Position

Fixed delta appearing on separate line below time instead of inline. Added:
- `top: 0` to deltaDisplay style for proper vertical positioning
- `translateY: timeTranslateY.value` to delta animation so it moves up along with the time

---

## [0.6.152] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Genre Page Loading Performance

Removed excessive console.log statements from useDownloadStatus hook. These were logging for every BookCard on mount, causing significant slowdown when loading pages with many books (like genre detail pages with 50+ books).

**Root cause identified:** Each BookCard makes a separate SQLite query via `downloadManager.getDownloadStatus()`. With 50 books, that's 50 DB queries. A more complete fix would batch these queries, but removing the console.logs provides immediate improvement.

---

## [0.6.151] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Delta Position Side-by-Side Without Shifting Time

Changed delta positioning to use `left: '50%'` with `marginLeft: scale(60)` so it appears just to the right of the centered time. The delta is absolutely positioned so changes to its content don't shift the time around. Re-added translateX animation for smooth slide-in effect.

---

## [0.6.150] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Separate Delta From Time

Made delta a separate absolutely positioned element (instead of nested Text) so it doesn't affect time's centered position when delta value changes.

---

## [0.6.149] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Delta Inline (Nested Text)

Switched back to nested Text approach for proper inline layout. Removed translateX animation (only opacity fade now) since nested text can't transform independently.

---

## [0.6.148] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Delta Inline With Time

Fixed delta text wrapping to next line. Now uses `alignItems: 'baseline'` and `flexWrap: 'nowrap'` to keep time and delta on the same line.

---

## [0.6.147] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Delta Slides Out From Center

Delta text now animates with opacity and translateX, sliding out from center towards the right (120ms).

Sequence:
1. Time shrinks and moves up (80ms)
2. 100ms delay
3. Delta fades in while sliding from left to right (120ms)

---

## [0.6.146] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Delayed Delta Reveal

Added 100ms delay before showing the delta text, so the resize animation completes first before the delta appears.

---

## [0.6.145] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Faster Animate In

Made the seeking animation faster on entry (80ms) while keeping exit at 150ms.

---

## [0.6.144] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Time Moves Up When Seeking

Time display now animates UP when seeking (translateY: -30), then back down to normal position when done.

- Base position restored to scale(8)
- When seeking: shrinks to 28pt AND moves up 30px
- When done: returns to 64pt at original position

---

## [0.6.143] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Move Time Display Up

Moved the time display up slightly (scale(8) → scale(20)) for better spacing above the progress bar.

---

## [0.6.142] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Time Display Center Animation

Fixed the center-shrink animation by using fontSize + translateY compensation instead of transform scale (which doesn't change layout and caused text wrapping issues).

**Approach:** Animate fontSize (64→28) plus translateY (0→18) to keep text visually centered while allowing proper layout reflow.

---

## [0.6.141] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Time Display Shrinks From Center

Changed from animating fontSize to using transform scale so the text shrinks from its center instead of the baseline.

**Before:** Text shrank toward baseline (bottom), causing visual jump
**After:** Text scales from center, smooth centered animation

---

## [0.6.140] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Seeking Time Display Size

Reduced seeking font size from 40pt to 28pt to ensure time + delta fits on one line.

---

## [0.6.139] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Animated Time Display Size During Seeking

The time display now animates to a smaller font size when seeking to fit both the time and delta on one line.

**Changes:**
- Font size animates from 64pt → 28pt when seeking starts
- Animates back to 64pt when seeking ends
- 150ms smooth transition using Reanimated

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx`

---

## [0.6.138] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Inline Seeking Delta Display

Moved the seeking delta indicator to display inline with the time, formatted as `00:00:00 | -30s`.

**Before:** Delta was shown as separate text above the time
**After:** Delta appears next to time with a pipe separator, colored with accent

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx`

---

## [0.6.137] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Remove Progress Bar Marker

Removed the circular marker dot from the progress bar. The fill color now indicates position without a separate marker.

**Removed:**
- Marker element from progress bar JSX
- `markerStyle` animated style
- `markerOnTrack` style
- `TRACK_MARKER_SIZE` constant

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx`

---

## [0.6.136] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Progress Bar Coordinate Accuracy

Fixed coordinate mismatch between gesture events and track content area.

**Issue:** Track had `borderWidth: 1` which created a 1px offset on left/right. Gesture events were measured relative to the outer container, but fill/marker were positioned in the track's content area (inside borders). This caused 2px total error.

**Fix:** Changed track to use `borderTopWidth: 1` only (no left/right borders). This aligns the gesture coordinate space with the content area.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Changed track border style

---

## [0.6.135] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Progress Bar Marker Overflow (Simplified Approach)

Completely rewrote marker positioning with a simpler, more robust approach.

**Previous Issue:** Complex clamping math was causing the marker to escape the track on both edges.

**New Approach:**
- Position marker center at `progress * trackWidth`
- Use CSS transform to center the marker: `translateX(-markerRadius)`
- Add `overflow: 'hidden'` to track to clip the marker at edges

This eliminates all the complex clamping math and lets the CSS handle edge cases naturally.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx`
  - Simplified `markerStyle` to use transform for centering
  - Added `overflow: 'hidden'` to track style

---

## [0.6.134] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Progress Bar Marker Double-Offset Bug

Fixed bug where the progress marker was still going outside the track bounds at position 0.

**Issue:** The marker was being offset twice:
1. Animated style: `left: clampedLeft - markerRadius` (subtracts 8px to center)
2. Static style: `marginLeft: -TRACK_MARKER_SIZE / 2` (subtracts another 8px)

This caused the marker to go 8px outside the left edge at position 0.

**Fix:**
- Removed duplicate `marginLeft` from static `markerOnTrack` style
- Centering is now handled only in the animated style

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Removed duplicate offset from markerOnTrack

---

## [0.6.133] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Progress Bar Marker Position

Fixed bug where the progress marker was going outside the track bounds.

**Issue:** Marker was using wrong constant (`PROGRESS_MARKER_SIZE` instead of `TRACK_MARKER_SIZE`) and wasn't clamped to track boundaries.

**Fix:**
- Updated marker position calculation to use correct `TRACK_MARKER_SIZE`
- Added clamping so marker stays within track bounds (min: marker radius from left, max: marker radius from right)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Fixed `markerStyle` calculation

---

## [0.6.132] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Transparent Player Controls in Dark Mode

Made the player control bar background fully transparent in dark mode so it floats cleanly over the cover artwork.

**Changes (dark mode only):**
- `widgetButtonBg`: Changed from `#1A1A1A` → `transparent`
- `widgetBorder`: Changed from `rgba(255,255,255,0.2)` → `transparent`
- `widgetTrack`: Changed from `#3A3A3A` → `rgba(255,255,255,0.2)` (lighter track)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/theme/colors.ts` - Updated dark mode player widget colors

---

## [0.6.131] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Player Time Display and Progress Bar

Made the current time display even bigger and simplified the progress bar design.

**Changes:**
- Time display: Increased to 64pt font, weight 800 (extra bold)
- Removed the stem/line from the progress marker
- Marker is now a dot directly on the progress bar track (16pt circle with shadow)
- Simplified layout by removing the marker area above the progress bar

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx`
  - Updated `currentTimeDisplay` style (larger, bolder)
  - Removed stem from SimpleProgressBar
  - Added `markerOnTrack` style for marker dot on the track
  - Updated `MARKER_AREA_HEIGHT` to just time row height

---

## [0.6.130] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Large Time Display on Player

Made the current time display above the progress bar large and bold like a title.

**Style:**
- Font size: 48pt (scaled)
- Font weight: 700 (bold)
- Width: 100%
- Tabular nums for consistent digit widths
- Letter spacing: -1 for tighter look

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Added `currentTimeDisplay` style

---

## [0.6.129] - 2026-01-07

### Changed - Player Layout: Swapped Chapter Name and Time

Swapped the positions of the chapter name and current time on the CDPlayerScreen.

**New Layout:**
- **Above progress bar**: Current time displayed prominently (was chapter name)
- **On progress bar (left)**: Chapter name - tappable to open chapters sheet (was current time)
- **On progress bar (right)**: Duration/remaining time (unchanged)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx`
  - Swapped chapter title and time positions
  - Added `onChapterPress` prop to SimpleProgressBar interface
  - Made chapter label tappable to open chapters sheet

---

## [0.6.128] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - BookDetailScreen Gradients

Updated BookDetailScreen to use theme-aware gradient colors from `colors.ts` instead of hardcoded values.

**Changes:**
- Top gradient: Now uses `themeColors.player.gradientStart/Mid/End` (was hardcoded dark rgba)
- Bottom gradient: Fixed to use correct nested path `themeColors.player.gradientStart/Mid` and `themeColors.background.primary`

**Result:**
- Light mode: White gradient fades over cover image
- Dark mode: Black gradient fades over cover image

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/BookDetailScreen.tsx` - Updated both gradient LinearGradients

---

## [0.6.127] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Text Color on Accent Backgrounds

Fixed text color on accent-colored backgrounds (pills, buttons) to use theme-aware `textOnAccent` color instead of hardcoded black. This ensures proper contrast when using the Electric Blue or other accent themes.

**Problem:** When accent color is used as a background (e.g., selected pills, primary buttons), text was hardcoded to black (`#000`), which is unreadable on dark accent colors like Electric Blue.

**Solution:** Added `textOnAccent` to color helpers and updated components to use dynamic text colors:
- Red/Gold theme: White text on accent
- Electric Blue theme: White text on blue
- Lime theme: Black text on lime (high contrast)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/components/Button.tsx` - Primary variant now uses `textOnAccent`
- `src/features/profile/screens/PlaybackSettingsScreen.tsx` - Smart rewind pills
- `src/features/profile/screens/JoystickSeekSettingsScreen.tsx` - Preset curve pills

---

## [0.6.126] - 2026-01-07

### Improved - Player Header Layout

Moved bookmark button into the header row next to settings, with drop shadows on all header icons for better visibility over cover art.

**Layout Change:**
- Before: Download (left), Close (center), Settings (right), Bookmark (absolute positioned at bottom-right of cover)
- After: Download (left), Close (center), Bookmark + Settings (right, grouped)

**Visual Enhancement:**
- Added drop shadows to all header icons (Download, Close, Bookmark, Settings)
- Shadows improve icon visibility when overlaid on light/dark cover images

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Header layout and shadow styles

---

## [0.6.125] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Silent Player Priming

Fixed audio playing briefly when loading a book without autoPlay (e.g., tapping hero cover).

**Problem:** When loading a book with `autoPlay: false`, expo-audio requires a "priming" workaround where we briefly play then pause to prevent the player from getting stuck in perpetual buffering. This caused audible playback for ~500ms.

**Solution:** Mute the player during priming (`volume = 0`) and restore volume after pausing.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Silent priming in `loadAudio()` and `loadTracks()`

---

## [0.6.124] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - Chapter Titles and Playback Transitions

**Chapter Title Normalization:**
- Applied chapter title cleaning to player chapters (was only applied to display, not playback)
- Numeric prefixes like "004 - Prologue" are now properly cleaned to show "Prologue"
- Both `mapSessionChapters()` and `extractChaptersFromBook()` now use `getCleanChapterName()`

**Track Transition Playback:**
- Added `verifyPlaybackAfterTransition()` to ensure playback actually starts after track changes
- Prevents audio stopping silently when transitioning between audio files/chapters
- Includes automatic retry logic (up to 2 retries with increasing delays)
- Emits status callback if playback fails to recover so UI shows correct state

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/player/utils/bookLoadingHelpers.ts` - Added chapter normalization
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Added playback verification after track transitions

---

## [0.6.123] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed - CDPlayerScreen Light/Dark Theme Support

Fixed CDPlayerScreen to properly support light and dark modes with correct gradient and text colors.

**Theme Changes:**
- Added gradient color properties (`gradientStart`, `gradientMid`, `gradientEnd`) to both light and dark mode player sections in colors.ts
- Light mode: white gradients + dark text
- Dark mode: black gradients + light text
- All colors now derived from the shared theme system

**Icon Improvements:**
- Header icons (download, close, settings) now use `themeColors.iconPrimary` for proper theme support
- Bookmark icon updated to use theme colors

- Redesigned header layout with centered close arrow, download status on left, settings on right

**Widget Fixes:**
- Fixed bottom-left corner not being rounded (changed `overflow: 'visible'` to `'hidden'`)
- Restored widget border (`widgetBorder`) visibility
- Set widget background to full black (`#000000`)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/theme/colors.ts` - Added gradient colors to light/dark player sections

- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Updated gradients and icons to use theme colors
- `src/navigation/components/GlobalMiniPlayer.tsx` - Timeline positioning adjustment

---

## [0.6.121] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed - Android Auto Player Controls

Fixed Android Auto transport controls (play, pause, skip, seek) which were not being forwarded to the player.

**Changes:**
- Transport commands from MediaPlaybackService are now properly handled in automotiveService.ts
- `play` → calls `playerStore.resume()`
- `pause` → calls `playerStore.pause()`
- `skipNext` → calls `playerStore.nextChapter()`
- `skipPrevious` → calls `playerStore.previousChapter()`
- `fastForward` → seeks forward 30 seconds
- `rewind` → seeks backward 30 seconds
- `seekTo` → seeks to specified position (already working)
- `playFromMediaId` → loads and plays book (already working)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/automotive/automotiveService.ts` - Added proper transport command handlers

---

## [0.6.120] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed - MyLibraryScreen Sources of Truth

Updated MyLibraryScreen to use correct and consistent sources of truth for all data.

**In-Progress Logic:**
- Now uses `useContinueListening()` (server API `/api/me/items-in-progress`) as the source of truth
- Previously only filtered downloaded books; now includes ALL in-progress books from server
- Added `serverInProgressBooks` computed value derived from `continueListeningItems`

**Completed/Finished Logic:**
- Combined `useFinishedBookIds()` (SQLite user_books) with `useCompletionStore.isComplete()` (manual marks)

- Sorted by the most recently played book in each series
- Uses `userMediaProgress.lastUpdate` timestamp for ordering

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/home/hooks/useHomeData.ts` - Updated seriesInProgress sorting logic

---

## [0.6.117] - 2026-01-04

## [0.6.114] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed - Playback Stability During Downloads

Fixed critical race conditions causing playback failures when downloading while streaming.

**Download Completion Fixes:**
- Increased reload delay from 500ms to 1500ms for mobile data stability
- Added `waitForSafeState()` - waits for seeking/loading to finish before reloading (up to 5s)
- Gets fresh position from audio service instead of using potentially stale saved position
- Clears smart rewind state before reload to prevent interference

**Smart Rewind Fixes:**

- Properly awaits `clearSmartRewindState()` instead of fire-and-forget
- Error handling ensures `isSeeking` is always cleared

**Stuck Audio Detection:**
- Added stuck detection in `play()` - if audio doesn't start after 3s, attempts recovery

---

## [0.6.113] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed - Search Pipeline Consistency

Comprehensive search fixes to ensure consistent matching across all search entry points.

**Bug Fixes:**
1. **Space-insensitive gate removed** - Now works for single-word queries like "earthsea" (not just "earth sea")
2. **Regex punctuation fix** - Fixed character class that was treating dots literally
3. **Autocomplete consistency** - Now uses same fuzzyMatch logic as full search for authors/series/narrators

Fixed severe search lag caused by expensive fuzzy matching on every keystroke.

**Optimizations:**
- Removed Levenshtein distance calculations from real-time filtering
- Simplified fuzzyMatch to use fast string operations only
- Pre-compute normalized queries once per search, not per item
- Levenshtein matching now only used for "Did you mean" suggestions

**Search still supports:**
- Substring matching ("earth" → "Earthsea")
- Word prefix matching ("ear" → "Earthsea")
- Space-insensitive matching ("earth sea" → "earthsea")
- Multi-word matching ("long sun" → "Lake of the Long Sun")

### Files Modified
- `src/features/search/utils/fuzzySearch.ts` - Simplified fuzzyMatch for performance
- `src/core/cache/libraryCache.ts` - Optimized filterItems text search

---

## [0.6.111] - 2026-01-03

### Enhanced - Fuzzier Search

Significantly improved search to handle more flexible queries:

**Space-Insensitive Matching**
- "earth sea" now matches "Earthsea" and vice versa
- Spaces, hyphens, and punctuation are normalized for comparison

**Word Reordering**
- "sea eart" matches "Earthsea" (word permutations checked)
- Words don't need to be in the correct order

**Partial Phrase Matching**
- "the quartet" matches "The Earthsea Quartet"
- All query words are checked against the target (any order)

**Enhanced Similarity Scoring**
- New `enhancedSimilarityScore()` function considers multiple matching strategies
- Better "Did you mean" suggestions using normalized comparisons

### Files Modified

## [0.6.105] - 2026-01-03

### Enhanced - Mood Discovery Questionnaire Redesign

Major redesign of the mood discovery quiz with UX research-backed improvements:

**Situational Questions (More Engaging)**
- Step 1: "It's your perfect listening moment. Where are you?" (was "What kind of experience?")
- Step 2: "What kind of energy fits right now?" (was "How should it feel to listen?")
- Step 3: "What emotional territory feels right?" (was "How heavy do you want it?")
- Step 4: "Where do you want the story to take you?" (was "What kind of world?")
- Step 5: NEW - "How much time do you have?" (length preference)

**New Option Labels (Concrete Imagery vs Abstract)**
- Mood: "Curled up at home", "Edge of your seat", "Lost in another world", etc.
- Energy: "Slow & savory", "Steady rhythm", "Can't put it down", "Surprise me"
- Tone: "Light & bright", "Shade & light", "Deep & intense"
- World: "Right here, right now", "Back in time", "Realms of magic", "Among the stars"
- Length: "Quick listen", "Weekend companion", "Epic journey"

**New Icons (Lucide React)**
- Mood: Sofa, Zap, Sparkles, Smile, Heart, Lightbulb
- Energy: Moon, Music, Flame, Shuffle
- Tone: Sun, CloudSun, CircleDot, Shuffle
- World: Building2, Castle, Wand2, Rocket, Globe
- Length: Timer, Calendar, Map, Infinity

**Match Attribution**
- Book cards now show small icons indicating which dimensions matched
- QuickTuneBar shows length filter chip when set

### Files Modified
- `src/features/mood-discovery/types.ts` - Updated all config arrays with new labels/icons, added LENGTHS, TOTAL_QUIZ_STEPS
- `src/features/mood-discovery/screens/MoodDiscoveryScreen.tsx` - Updated to 5 steps, new questions
- `src/features/mood-discovery/stores/moodSessionStore.ts` - Added setDraftLength, updated for 5 steps
- `src/features/mood-discovery/components/MoodBookCard.tsx` - Added match attribution icons
- `src/features/mood-discovery/components/QuickTuneBar.tsx` - Added length chip

## [0.6.104] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed - Navigation Error in Preferences Onboarding

Fixed "RESET action was not handled" error when completing preferences onboarding.

**Problem:**
`PreferencesOnboardingScreen` tried to navigate to `{ name: 'Browse' }` which doesn't
exist in the navigator. The tab is actually named "DiscoverTab".

**Solution:**
Changed to `navigation.goBack()` to simply close the modal and return to the
previous screen where the user's preferences are now active.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/recommendations/screens/PreferencesOnboardingScreen.tsx`
  - Changed `navigation.reset()` to `navigation.goBack()`

---

## [0.6.103] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed - Infinite Loop in Dismissed Items Store

Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" error caused by Zustand selector hooks
returning new array references on every render.

**Problem:**
`useDismissedIds()` and `useDismissedCount()` used `Object.keys()` directly
in the selector, creating new arrays on each call. This triggered infinite
re-renders.

**Solution:**
- Added `useShallow` from `zustand/shallow` for stable object references
- Wrapped `Object.keys()` in `useMemo` to memoize the derived array
- Only recalculates when `dismissedItems` actually changes

### Files Modified
- `src/features/recommendations/stores/dismissedItemsStore.ts`
  - Added `useShallow` import from `zustand/shallow`
  - Added `useMemo` import from React
  - Fixed `useDismissedIds` to use `useShallow` + `useMemo`
  - Fixed `useDismissedCount` to use `useShallow` + `useMemo`

---

## [0.6.102] - 2026-01-03

### Added - Personalized Recommendation Enhancements (P0 Gaps)

Implemented three major improvements to the recommendation system based on UX research:

**Gap 1: "Because You Finished X" Attribution**
- Row titles now show specific book attribution: "Because you finished The Blade Itself"
- Book name in title is tappable - navigates to that book's detail page
- SQLite now tracks most recent finished book and currently listening books
- Title variations: "More like X", "Because you love [Genre]", "More by [Author]"

**Gap 2: Serendipity Row ("Try Something Different")**
- New row showing books OUTSIDE user's comfort zone
- Deliberately selects books from genres user hasn't explored
- Purple sparkle (✨) badge on cards for visual distinction
- Helps users discover new genres and authors

**Gap 3: "Not Interested" Feedback System**
- Swipe left on any book card to dismiss from recommendations
- Toast appears with "Undo" button for 5 seconds
- Dismissed books stored in `dismissedItemsStore` (persisted)
- New "Hidden Books" screen in Profile > Recommendations
- Shows count badge, allows bulk restore

**Also Added:**
- New "Recommendations" section in Profile screen
- "Preferences" link to tune recommendations
- "Hidden Books" link with count badge

### New Files
- `src/features/recommendations/stores/dismissedItemsStore.ts`
- `src/features/discover/components/SwipeableBookCard.tsx`
- `src/features/discover/components/DismissToast.tsx`
- `src/features/profile/screens/HiddenItemsScreen.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - Added mostRecentFinished and currentlyListening to getReadHistoryStats
- `src/features/discover/types.ts` - Added SourceAttribution interface and isSerendipity flags
- `src/features/recommendations/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` - Added source attribution to groups, filter dismissed items
- `src/features/discover/hooks/useDiscoverData.ts` - Generate specific row titles, added serendipity row
- `src/features/discover/components/ContentRowCarousel.tsx` - Tappable source links, serendipity badge
- `src/features/profile/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Added Recommendations section with Preferences and Hidden Books links
- `src/features/profile/index.ts` - Export HiddenItemsScreen
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Added HiddenItems route

---

## [0.6.101] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed - Recommendations Now Show for All Users

Removed the `hasPreferences` gate that was blocking recommendations for new users
who hadn't completed onboarding or built any listening history.

**Problem:**
Recommendations only showed if `hasPreferences = true`, which required either:
- Completing the onboarding questionnaire, OR
- Having finished at least 1 book, OR
- Having started listening to at least 1 book

New users with none of these would only see "New This Week" and no recommendations.

**Solution:**
- Removed `hasPreferences` check from `recommendationRows` useMemo
- Recommendations now show for ALL users based on random scoring
- Users with history still get personalized recommendations (higher scores)
- Users without history see "Recommended for You" fallback group with variety picks

**Also fixed in previous session (0.6.100):**
- Added fallback "Recommended for You" group for ungrouped items in `useRecommendations.ts`
- Books with only random scores (no specific author/narrator/genre match) now appear in recommendations

### Files Modified
- `src/features/discover/hooks/useDiscoverData.ts`
  - Removed `hasPreferences` from recommendationRows condition
  - Removed `hasPreferences` from useMemo dependency array
- `src/features/recommendations/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` (0.6.100)
  - Added "Recommended for You" fallback group

---

## [0.6.100] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Preferences Onboarding Genres Not Loading

The "What genres do you enjoy?" screen (step 2 of 4) was showing empty options.

**Problem:**
Used `useAllLibraryItems()` + `extractGenres()` which depended on prefetch service,
but the data wasn't loaded when navigating to onboarding.

**Solution:**
Changed to use `useLibraryCache()` + `getGenresByPopularity()` which uses the
already-populated library cache.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/recommendations/screens/PreferencesOnboardingScreen.tsx`
  - Replaced `useAllLibraryItems` + `useDefaultLibrary` with `useLibraryCache`
  - Now uses `getGenresByPopularity()` for genres

---

## [0.6.99] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Recommendations Now Working

Two fixes to make recommendations actually appear on the Browse page:

**Fix 1: Browse page only showed first content row**
- Changed `rows.slice(0, 1)` to `rows.map()` to show all rows
- Simplified to only show: Recommendations + "New This Week"
- Removed: Not Started, Short & Sweet, Long Listens, Continue Series

**Fix 2: Listening history metadata was empty**
- `getListeningHistoryStats()` queried SQLite `user_books` table which didn't have metadata
- Now builds listening stats directly from library items (`allItems`) using `useMemo`
- Properly extracts author/narrator/genres from `userMediaProgress` on each item

### Files Modified
- `src/features/browse/screens/BrowseScreen.tsx` - Show all rows (removed slice)
- `src/features/discover/hooks/useDiscoverData.ts` - Only include recommendations + New This Week
- `src/features/recommendations/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` - Build listening stats from library cache

---

## [0.6.98] - 2026-01-02

### Added - Recommendations from Listening History (In-Progress Books)

Extended the recommendation engine to also factor in books currently being listened to,
not just finished books.

**What Changed:**

1. **New SQLite Method:** Added `getListeningHistoryStats()` to query user_books for in-progress books
   - Returns authors, narrators, and genres from books with 0-95% progress
   - Ordered by count and progress (more progress = more relevant)

2. **Dual Scoring System:**
   - Finished books: Full weight (40-80 points for authors, 30-60 for narrators, up to 50 for genres)
   - In-progress books: 60% weight (~25-50 for authors, ~18-36 for narrators, up to 30 for genres)
   - Listening history only boosts when finished history doesn't already boost

3. **New Recommendation Group:** "Based on what you're listening to"
   - Appears after "Based on your reading history"
   - Shows recommendations from currently-listening patterns

4. **Updated hasPreferences Logic:**
   - Now returns `true` if user has:
     - Completed onboarding questionnaire, OR
     - Finished at least 1 book, OR
     - Started listening to at least 1 book

**Example:**
If a user starts listening to a Brandon Sanderson book, they'll immediately see
recommendations for other Sanderson books, even with no finished books.

### Fixed - Browse Page Content Rows Not Displaying

Fixed a critical bug where only the first content row was displayed on the Browse page.

**Problem:**
`rows.slice(0, 1)` was limiting display to just ONE row, hiding:
- All recommendation rows (priority 2.x)
- Continue Series, Not Started, Short & Sweet, Long Listens rows

**Solution:**
Changed to `rows.map()` to display all content rows sorted by priority.

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - Added `getListeningHistoryStats()` method
- `src/features/recommendations/hooks/useRecommendations.ts`:
  - Added `ListeningHistoryStats` interface
  - Fetch and use listening stats
  - Added listening history scoring (60% weight of finished books)
  - Added "Based on what you're listening to" group
  - Updated `hasPreferences` to include in-progress books
- `src/features/browse/screens/BrowseScreen.tsx` - Fixed `rows.slice(0, 1)` to show all rows

---

## [0.6.97] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Unified "Finished" Threshold (Single Source of Truth)

Standardized the threshold for considering a book "finished" across the entire app.

**Problem:**
Different parts of the codebase used different thresholds:
- SQLite auto-finish: 99%
- Reading history: 95%
- Recommendations: 95%
- Progress service: 99%

**Solution:**
Unified to **95%** everywhere with `FINISHED_THRESHOLD` exported from `useReadingHistory`.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/reading-history-wizard/hooks/useReadingHistory.ts` - Export `FINISHED_THRESHOLD`
- `src/features/reading-history-wizard/index.ts` - Export constant
- `src/core/services/sqliteCache.ts` - Changed from 99% to 95%
- `src/core/services/finishedBooksSync.ts` - Changed from 99% to 95%
- `src/features/player/stores/progressStore.ts` - Changed `COMPLETION_THRESHOLD` from 99% to 95%
- `src/features/player/services/progressService.ts` - Changed from 99% to 95%
- `src/features/player/utils/progressCalculator.ts` - Changed default from 99% to 95%
- `src/features/player/stores/__tests__/progressStore.test.ts` - Updated tests

---

## [0.6.96] - 2026-01-02

### Added - Preferences Promo Card on Browse Page

Added a promo card at the bottom of the Browse page to encourage users to fill out
the preferences questionnaire even if they don't have any finished books yet.

**Features:**
- Shows "Get Personalized Recommendations" card with sparkle icon
- Only appears when user hasn't completed onboarding AND has no reading history
- Tapping navigates to PreferencesOnboardingScreen
- Card hidden once user has either completed onboarding or finished a book

### Files Modified
- `src/features/discover/components/PreferencesPromoCard.tsx` - New component
- `src/features/discover/index.ts` - Export new component
- `src/features/discover/hooks/useDiscoverData.ts` - Expose hasPreferences
- `src/features/browse/screens/BrowseScreen.tsx` - Add promo card at bottom

---

## [0.6.95] - 2026-01-02

### Changed - Browse Page Now Shows Recommendations Without Onboarding

Enabled personalized recommendations on the Browse page for users with reading history,
even if they haven't completed the preferences onboarding questionnaire.

**Previously:**
- Recommendations only appeared if `hasCompletedOnboarding=true`
- Users without onboarding only saw static sections: "New This Week", "Short & Sweet", etc.

**Now:**
- Recommendations appear if user has completed onboarding OR has finished at least 1 book
- The recommendation engine uses reading history (favorite authors, narrators, genres from completed books) to generate personalized suggestions
- "New This Week" appears AFTER recommendations (priority 3 vs 2.x) as intended

### Files Modified
- `src/features/recommendations/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` - Added reading history check to `hasPreferences` return value

---

## [0.6.94] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Repeated API Calls for Deleted Books During Scroll
Fixed performance issue causing repeated failed API calls and scroll lag.

**Root Cause:**
When a book was deleted from the server but still had a download record locally,
`downloadManager.getAllDownloads()` would try to fetch the library item metadata
from the API every time it was called. Since this failed, it would retry on every
notification cycle, causing repeated API calls and degraded scroll performance.

**Fix Applied:**
Added a failed fetch cache with 5-minute cooldown to prevent repeated API calls:
- Failed API fetches are cached with timestamp
- Subsequent calls skip the API request until cooldown expires
- Successful fetches clear the item from the cache

### Files Modified
- `src/core/services/downloadManager.ts` - Added failedFetchCache with cooldown logic

---

## [0.6.93] - 2026-01-02

### Changed - Browse "View More" Screen: 3-Column Layout & Scroll Fix
Improved the FilteredBooksScreen (accessed via "View More" on browse sections).

**Changes:**
1. **3-column grid**: Changed from 2 columns to 3 columns for denser book display
2. **Simplified cards**: Removed author/narrator text (too small for 3-column layout), now shows just cover + title
3. **Fixed scroll lag**: Optimized FlatList rendering settings:
   - `initialNumToRender`: 6 → 16 (4 rows pre-rendered)
   - `maxToRenderPerBatch`: 6 → 12 (faster batch rendering)
   - `windowSize`: 5 → 7 (larger buffer)
   - `removeClippedSubviews`: true → false (fixes rendering glitches)
4. **Fixed getItemLayout**: Now correctly calculates row offsets for 3-column layout
5. **Tighter spacing**: Reduced gap and margins for compact 3-column grid

### Files Modified
- `src/features/library/screens/FilteredBooksScreen.tsx`

---

## [0.6.92] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Streaming Playback for Completed Books
Critical fix for playback breaking after streaming a book to completion.

**Root Cause:**
When a streaming book completed, the position was saved at the end (position = duration). On next play attempt:
1. Player loaded at position = duration
2. HLS stream immediately signaled completion
3. Playback got stuck and couldn't recover, even after force closing app

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **BookDetailScreen**: When a completed book is played ("Play Again" button), now always starts from beginning
   - `handlePlayPress()` now checks `isCompleted` before `isDownloaded`/streaming
   - Uses `handlePlayFromBeginning()` which passes `startPosition: 0`

2. **playerStore safeguard**: Added position clamp in `loadBook()`
   - If resume position is within 5 seconds of total duration, resets to 0
   - Prevents stream from immediately triggering completion
   - Provides defense-in-depth even if UI doesn't handle it

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/screens/BookDetailScreen.tsx` - Fixed handlePlayPress to use handlePlayFromBeginning for completed books
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Added position clamp safeguard near end of book

---

## [0.6.80] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Memory Leak and Re-render Optimization
Dramatic performance improvements through optimized React subscriptions.

**Performance Results:**
- **Re-renders reduced 97%**: CDPlayerScreen renders dropped from 324+ to 9
- **Memory usage reduced 57%**: From 1.3GB+ to ~560MB
- **Memory growth rate**: From rapid accumulation to stable ~1MB per minute

**Optimizations Applied:**
- **Position subscription**: Floor position to whole seconds before comparison
  - Previously triggered re-render on every position tick (~2x/sec)
  - Now only re-renders when the second value actually changes (~1x/sec)
- **Sleep timer subscription**: Round to coarse granularity based on remaining time
  - >5 min: Round to nearest minute (reduces 60 re-renders/min to 1)
  - ≤5 min: Round to nearest 10 seconds for countdown display

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Optimized store subscriptions

---

## [0.6.79] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Playback Stability Improvements
Additional fixes for track switching and position handling issues.

**Critical Fixes:**
- **Track cascade bug**: Added guard in `handleTrackEnd()` to ignore spurious `didJustFinish` events
  - Pre-buffered tracks could report `didJustFinish=true` with `duration=0` or `position=0`
  - This caused a cascade of track advances (skipping 30+ minutes forward)
  - Now ignores events where `playerDuration <= 0 || currentPlayerPos < 1`
- **Extended track switch timeout**: Changed from 500ms to 1500ms
  - Gives slower network/track loads more time to complete
- **Removed strict position validation**: Removed 60s position rejection that was blocking legitimate seeks
  - The validation was too strict and prevented chapter jumps
  - Kept logging only for debugging

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Track cascade guard, extended timeout, removed position rejection
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Removed strict position validation

---

## [0.6.78] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Player Control Button Touch Targets
- **Increased control bar height**: Changed from 64 to 72 scaled pixels for better touch area
- **Added hitSlop to all control buttons**: Extended touch area by 12px vertically and 8px horizontally
- **Added minHeight to control buttons**: Ensures minimum 48px touch target for accessibility
- **Adjusted progress bar position**: Moved up to maintain proper spacing from larger control bar

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Control button touch improvements

---

## [0.6.77] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Playback Position Stability
Comprehensive audit and fixes for random position jumps during streaming playback.

**Critical Fixes:**
- **Track switch position race condition**: Set `lastKnownGoodPosition` BEFORE changing `currentTrackIndex`
  - Previously, during track switches there was a 500ms window where position could be calculated from wrong track's startOffset
  - Now pre-sets the target global position before any track index changes
- **Background sync overwrites active playback**: Added protection check in conflict resolution
  - Previously, server sync could overwrite local position even during active playback
  - Now detects if audio is playing and protects local position from being overwritten
- **Undefined server timestamp handling**: Use 0 instead of `Date.now()` when `updatedAt` is undefined
  - Previously, undefined timestamps defaulted to current time, causing server position to falsely win conflicts
  - Now treats missing timestamps as oldest (0), ensuring local position has priority
- **Position validation layer**: Reject position updates > 60 seconds unless explicitly seeking
  - Prevents unexpected large position jumps from reaching the UI
  - Logs rejected jumps for debugging

**Debug Instrumentation Added:**
- Position jump detection in `audioService.ts:getGlobalPositionSync()` - logs jumps > 30 seconds
- Position change logging in `playerStore.ts:updatePlaybackState()` - logs all significant position changes
- Sync conflict logging in `backgroundSyncService.ts` - detailed conflict resolution logging

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Track switch timing fix, position jump detection
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Position validation layer, undefined timestamp fix, position logging
- `src/features/player/services/backgroundSyncService.ts` - Active playback protection, conflict logging

---

## [0.6.76] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed - Memory Leaks
Comprehensive memory leak audit and fixes to prevent memory accumulation over time.

**Critical Fixes:**
- **AnalyticsService metrics array**: Added `MAX_METRICS = 500` bound to prevent unbounded growth
  - Previously, `metrics` array grew indefinitely with each performance metric tracked
  - Now trims to last 500 entries when exceeded
- **AnalyticsService initialization error handling**: Added proper cleanup of resources on init failure
  - Clears `flushInterval` and removes `appStateSubscription` if initialization fails after setup

**Moderate Fixes:**
- **WebSocket reconnect timer**: Clear pending reconnect timer at start of `connect()`
  - Prevents edge case where manual `connect()` call could leave orphaned timer
- **WebSocket reconnect callback**: Only increment attempts if still in reconnecting state
  - Prevents inflated attempt counter if connection was established via other means

### Files Modified
- `src/core/analytics/analyticsService.ts` - Add metrics array bound, improve error handling
- `src/core/services/websocketService.ts` - Improve timer cleanup edge cases

---

## [0.6.75] - 2026-01-01

### Performance Improvements
Comprehensive player performance audit and fixes to eliminate UI lag and unnecessary re-renders.

**Critical Fixes:**
- **enterDirectScrub callback**: Removed position from dependencies, uses `getState()` instead
  - Previously recreated ~2x/sec during playback, now stable
- **Timeline useEffect throttle**: Added 100ms throttle to position-based timeline updates
  - Reduces unnecessary work during playback

**Moderate Fixes:**
- **Batched store subscriptions**: Combined 10 individual action subscriptions into single `useShallow` call
- **Sheet handler callbacks**: Created stable `closeSheet`, `openChapters`, `openSettings`, `openQueue` callbacks
  - Replaced 8 inline arrow functions in JSX
- **ChapterListItem component**: Extracted memoized component for chapter list
  - Prevents re-render of all chapters on position update

**Polish:**
- **Memoized insets styles**: `safeAreaStyles.topSpacer/bottomSpacer` instead of inline objects
- **Memoized time formatting**: `formattedPosition/formattedDuration` only recalculate on whole second change

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - All performance fixes

### Documentation
- `docs/PLAYER_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` - Comprehensive audit report with findings and fixes

---

## [0.6.74] - 2026-01-01

  - Now respects intentional rewinds on another device
  - The more recently updated position wins, not the higher one
  - New `positionResolver.ts` utility for unified resolution logic

- **Offline playback: No more jarring seek (FIX 2)**
  - Races session against 2-second timeout instead of fire-and-forget
  - Position is resolved BEFORE playback starts
  - If session arrives in time, uses timestamp-based resolution
  - If timeout, uses local progress and connects session in background for sync only

- **Background sync: Properly awaited before app suspension (FIX 1)**
  - `forceSyncAll()` now awaited with 4-second timeout (iOS has ~5s before suspension)
  - Prevents data loss when user backgrounds the app during playback
  - Added tracking/warning when sync times out

- **Queue debounce: Always save, process with debounce (FIX 4)**
  - Removed 10-second position delta threshold for queueing
  - Small rewinds (< 10 seconds) are now properly saved
  - Queue processing happens after 5s of inactivity OR 30s max delay
  - Prevents losing small position changes when closing app quickly

- **Large seeks: Immediate sync (FIX 5)**
  - Seeks > 1 minute trigger immediate server sync (fire-and-forget)
  - Ensures server knows about significant position changes quickly
  - Reduces risk of losing progress if app is closed immediately after seeking

### Technical Details
- Position resolver uses 30-second "same session" window for forward-progress (max)
- Outside that window, compares `updatedAt` timestamps
- Added `updatedAt` field to sessionService's PlaybackSession interface
- Background sync uses debounced scheduler instead of threshold-based queueing

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/utils/positionResolver.ts` - NEW: Unified position resolution
- `src/features/player/utils/index.ts` - Export position resolver
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Use resolver, fix offline path, add immediate sync
- `src/features/player/services/backgroundSyncService.ts` - Await with timeout, debounced queue

## [0.6.42] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Author detail screen: Books not showing for authors with name variations**
  - Issue: "Bill Martin" author page showed "No books found" even though book was authored by "Bill Martin Jr."
  - Root cause: Cache indexed books by exact author name string, missing variations (Jr./Sr. suffixes, co-authors)

  - Falls back to cache-based matching if API fetch fails

### Technical Details
- Added `authorBooks` state to store API-fetched books
- Added `useEffect` to call `getAuthor(id, { include: 'items' })` when author ID is available
- `sortedBooks` now prefers API-fetched books over cache name-matching

---

## [0.6.13] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Scrub position not persisting when paused**
  - Timeline scrubbing while paused then hitting play would jump back to original position
  - **Root cause**: Timeline scrubbing wasn't calling `audioService.setScrubbing()`, so SmartRewind would activate on play using the OLD pause position
  - **Fix 1**: Added `audioService.setScrubbing(true/false)` calls to timeline scrub enter/exit
  - **Fix 2**: `seekTo()` now updates playerStore.position immediately (not just waiting for slow 2000ms polling callback when paused)

- **Jarring position jump when loading a book**
  - Book would show stale position from previous book during loading, then jump to correct position
  - **Fix**: Now fetches saved position early (from local SQLite) and sets it immediately before async loading begins
  - Position is displayed correctly from the start of loading

### Changed
- **Standard Player cover now matches book detail page style**
  - Centered square cover (320px) instead of full-width
  - Rounded corners with drop shadow
  - Blurred background with light tint (like book detail page)
  - Queue/bookmark overlay buttons repositioned for smaller cover

### Files Modified

- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.12] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Chapter markers appearing in wrong positions on timeline**
  - **Root cause**: Tick positions were stored in pixels using a hardcoded TIMELINE_WIDTH (300), but rendered using device-dependent TIMELINE_WIDTH (SCREEN_WIDTH - scale(44))
  - **Fix**: Tick positions now stored in seconds (time-based), converted to pixels at render time
  - This ensures cached ticks work correctly across all device screen sizes
  - Tick cache version bumped to v3 to invalidate old pixel-based caches

### Technical Details
- Changed `TimelineTick.x` (pixels) to `TimelineTick.time` (seconds)
- Updated `getVisibleTicks()` to filter by time instead of pixels
- CDPlayerScreen now converts `tick.time * PIXELS_PER_SECOND` when rendering

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/utils/tickGenerator.ts` - Store tick positions in seconds
- `src/features/player/services/tickCache.ts` - Bump cache version to v3
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Convert seconds to pixels at render
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.11] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Documentation error in PLAYER_DEEP_DIVE.md**
  - Corrected seeking system documentation that incorrectly described timeline scrubbing
  - Now clearly distinguishes between two seek mechanisms:
    - **Timeline scrubbing**: Uses `isDirectScrubbing` (local UI state) + Reanimated shared values (60fps)
    - **Continuous seeking** (FF/RW buttons): Uses `isSeeking` in playerStore
  - Previous documentation incorrectly claimed timeline scrubbing sets `isSeeking = true`

### Files Modified
- `docs/PLAYER_DEEP_DIVE.md` - Fixed seeking system documentation
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.10] - 2025-12-30

- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump

---

## [0.6.9] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- **Timeline tick caching system** - Pre-generates and caches timeline ticks for better performance
  - Downloaded books: Ticks are pre-generated and persisted to AsyncStorage after download completes
  - Last played book: Ticks are pre-warmed in memory when home screen loads
  - Falls back to on-demand generation if cache miss (still functional, just first load may be slower)

### Changed
- **ChapterTimelineProgressBar** - Now accepts `libraryItemId` prop for tick cache lookup
- **Download flow** - Generates and caches ticks after download completes (non-blocking)
- **Home screen** - Pre-warms tick cache for current/last played book on load

### Technical Details
- New files:
  - `src/features/player/services/tickCache.ts` - Cache service with memory + AsyncStorage
  - `src/features/player/utils/tickGenerator.ts` - Tick generation utilities

## [0.6.4] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Android crash on player screen** - Fixed "Canvas: trying to draw too large bitmap" crash
  - SVG timeline for chapter view was rendering at full audiobook duration width (e.g., 40,000+ pixels for 10-hour books)
  - Android has a canvas size limit (~100MB), causing crash when loading long audiobooks
  - Implemented viewport-based rendering: SVG is now fixed at ~2100px width
  - Tick positions are calculated relative to a sliding viewport window
  - Ticks only render within ±15 minutes of current playback position (already existed)
  - Now the SVG width matches the visible window instead of full duration

- **Image blur crash on Android** - Made blur effects iOS-only
  - expo-image `blurRadius` was causing massive bitmap allocation on Android
  - Changed to `blurRadius={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? value : 0}` for cover images

- **Performance warning red screens** - Changed console.error to console.warn in useScreenLoadTime
  - Dev client was showing red error screens for slow screen mounts
  - Now uses console.warn which shows yellow instead of blocking red

- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Viewport-based timeline SVG rendering
- `src/core/hooks/useScreenLoadTime.ts` - console.error → console.warn

  - Now: Scrubbing is clamped only to book bounds (0 to duration), allowing free navigation across chapters
  - User can now scrub from any position to any other position in the book
  - Boundary haptics now trigger at book start/end instead of chapter boundaries

### Files Modified
- `src/shared/components/CoverPlayButton.tsx` - Changed clamp bounds from chapter to book in scrub interval and endScrub

---

## [0.5.73] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Position Overwritten During endScrub Delay** - Fixed final position race condition in scrub seek
  - Root cause: During 50ms delay after seek, audio callbacks overwrote store position with stale values
  - Example: Store set to 1001s, then callback overwrote with 972s, causing wrong resume position
  - Solution 1: Modified `updatePlaybackState()` to skip position updates when `isSeeking=true`
  - Solution 2: Modified `endScrub()` to use `isSeeking` flag for entire operation including 50ms delay
  - Flow: Set `isSeeking=true` → seek → delay → set `position` AND clear `isSeeking` together
  - Position updates are now blocked during the entire endScrub operation

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Check `isSeeking` in `updatePlaybackState()` before updating position
- `src/shared/components/CoverPlayButton.tsx` - Use `isSeeking` flag to block updates during endScrub

---

## [0.5.72] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Store Position Not Updated After Scrub** - Fixed position mismatch between store and audio
  - Root cause: `audioService.seekTo()` updated `lastKnownGoodPosition` but not the store
  - Store's `position` was stale from before scrubbing started
  - Example: Audio at 971s but store reported 998s, causing wrong position on resume
  - Solution: Added `usePlayerStore.setState({ position: finalPosition })` after seek
  - Store position now matches actual audio position after scrubbing

### Files Modified
- `src/shared/components/CoverPlayButton.tsx` - Update store position after final seek

---

## [0.5.71] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Track Switch Not Executing After Scrub** - Fixed position snap-back when scrubbing across track boundaries
  - Root cause: `endScrub()` called `seekTo()` while `isScrubbing=true`, which queued track switches
  - Then `setScrubbing(false)` cleared the pending switch without executing it
  - Audio remained on old track at wrong position, causing snap-back on play
  - Solution: Clear scrubbing flag BEFORE final seek, so track switches execute immediately
  - Example: Scrub from 265s→117s now correctly switches tracks instead of snapping back to 265s

### Files Modified
- `src/shared/components/CoverPlayButton.tsx` - Moved `setScrubbing(false)` before `seekTo()`

---

## [0.5.70] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **SmartRewind Race Condition** - Fixed bug where SmartRewind could apply old position after scrubbing
  - Root cause: `clearSmartRewind()` was fire-and-forget, AsyncStorage clear could be incomplete
  - When `play()` was called after scrub, `restoreSmartRewindState()` would read stale AsyncStorage data
  - Solution: Added `skipNextSmartRewind` flag in audioService, set when scrubbing starts
  - `play()` now checks and consumes this flag before applying SmartRewind
  - Added log message `[SmartRewind] Skipping - just finished scrubbing` for debugging

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Added `skipNextSmartRewind` flag and `consumeSkipSmartRewind()` method
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Check skip flag before applying SmartRewind

---

## [0.5.69] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Scrubbing Performance** - Fixed lag during joystick scrubbing
  - Root cause: React state updating at ~40fps causing excessive re-renders
  - Solution: Throttle scrub offset React state updates to 100ms intervals
  - Added `scrubOffsetShared` (Reanimated shared value) for immediate updates
  - Added `scrubOffsetDisplay` (throttled React state) for text displays
  - CDPlayerScreen now re-renders at ~10fps max during scrubbing (was ~40fps)
  - Timeline animations remain smooth using Reanimated shared values

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Added throttled scrub offset handling

---

## [0.5.68] - 2025-12-28

### Added

---

## [0.5.60] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Critical: SmartRewind triggering on scrub release** - Audio jumping back
  - Root cause: SmartRewind detected "pause" during scrub and rewound on resume
  - SmartRewind state now cleared when scrub starts
  - Pause during scrub no longer records SmartRewind state
  - Added `audioService.getIsScrubbing()` getter
  - Added `playerStore.clearSmartRewind()` action

  ```
  BEFORE (audio jumped back 230s):
    Scrub to 721s → Release → SmartRewind from old 465s pause → Audio at 460s!

  AFTER (correct):
    Scrub starts → clearSmartRewind() → No old state
    Pause during scrub → Skip SmartRewind recording
    Resume → No rewind applied → Audio at 721s ✓
  ```

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Added `getIsScrubbing()` getter
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Added `clearSmartRewind()`, check scrubbing in pause

---

## [0.5.58] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Critical: Audio not seeking to scrub position** - Await seek completion
  - `endScrub()` now async, awaits `seekTo()` before resuming playback
  - Added 50ms settle delay after seek before clearing scrubbing flag
  - Scrubbing flag stays ON during final seek (prevents callback overwrite)
  - All `player.seekTo()` calls now properly awaited in audioService
  - Removed setTimeout for trackSwitchInProgress clear (use await instead)

  ```
  BEFORE (race condition):
    setScrubbing(false)  ← Protection removed
    seekTo(500s)         ← Fire-and-forget
    play()               ← Immediate, audio still at 464s!

  AFTER (correct order):
    await seekTo(500s)   ← Wait for seek
    await delay(50ms)    ← Let audio settle
    setScrubbing(false)  ← Safe to clear
    play()               ← Audio at 500s ✓
  ```

### Files Modified
- `src/shared/components/CoverPlayButton.tsx` - Async endScrub, await seek
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Await all player.seekTo() calls

---

## [0.5.57] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Scrub Position Sync** - Fixed position lag during joystick scrubbing
  - Added `audioService.setPosition()` - updates cached position without seeking
  - Scrub interval now calls `setPosition()` on EVERY update (not throttled)
  - `seekTo()` remains throttled for actual audio seeking
  - `lastKnownGoodPosition` now always reflects current scrub position

  ```
  BEFORE (position could lag):
    scrub interval → throttled seekTo() → lastKnownGoodPosition

  AFTER (position always current):
    scrub interval → setPosition() (immediate) + seekTo() (throttled)
  ```

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/services/audioService.ts` - Added `setPosition()` method
- `src/shared/components/CoverPlayButton.tsx` - Call `setPosition()` on every scrub update

  - Removed direct position writes from CoverPlayButton (joystick scrubber)
  - Simplified `playerStore.seekTo()` to only call `audioService.seekTo()`
  - Simplified `playerStore.updatePlaybackState()` to always accept position from audioService
  - Removed `lastSeekCommitTime` and `SEEK_SETTLING_MS` (no longer needed)
  - Position flow: `audioService.lastKnownGoodPosition` → callback → `playerStore.position` → UI
  - UI joystick preview uses `scrubOffset` (not position writes)

### Fixed
- **Cross-chapter scrubbing stability** - No more position flashing or multiple streams
  - Race condition fixed: `trackSwitchInProgress` flag set BEFORE `currentTrackIndex` update
  - audioService.seekTo() updates `lastKnownGoodPosition` immediately

## [0.4.37] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **Series Sequencing for Non-Sequenced Books**: When a series has no explicit sequence numbers (all books show as #1), the app now:
  - Detects when all books have the same sequence number and treats that as "no sequence"
  - Removes the sequence number display from book titles (no more "1. Book Title")

---

## [0.4.36] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **Double Playback Race Condition (Complete Fix)**: Fixed the root cause of double playback where streaming a book while sync data was loading caused two audio streams to play simultaneously. The bug occurred because:
  - The "same book already loaded" check ran AFTER unloading audio, so it always failed
  - A second `loadBook` call could bypass the debounce if enough time passed
  - Fixed by moving the check BEFORE unloading audio, so we properly detect when the book is already playing and skip the reload

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Moved same-book check before unloadAudio() call
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.4.36

---

## [0.4.35] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **Double Playback Race Condition (Partial)**: Initial attempt to fix double playback. Added protection to:
  - Prevent loading the same book if it's already being loaded
  - Debounce all rapid load requests (not just different books)
  - Note: This fix was incomplete - see 0.4.36 for the complete fix

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/stores/playerStore.ts` - Added same-book loading guard and improved debouncing
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.4.35

---

## [0.4.34] - 2025-12-18

### Enhanced
- **Chapter Name Cleaning - Player Page**: Extended chapter name cleaning to the full-screen player (CDPlayerScreen). Clean chapter names now display in:
  - Chapters sheet when tapping the chapter list
  - Current chapter display below the progress bar

### Files Modified
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Uses normalized chapter names in chapters sheet and current chapter display
- `src/constants/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.4.34

---

## [0.4.33] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Chapter Name Cleaning**: Client-side normalization of messy chapter names for a polished display experience. Based on analysis of 68,000+ real audiobook chapter titles:
  - Comprehensive pattern parser handles 15+ chapter formats (track numbers, disc codes, Roman numerals, spelled-out numbers, front/back matter)
  - Four cleaning levels: Off, Light, Standard (recommended), Aggressive
  - Settings screen at Profile → Settings → Chapter Names with live examples
  - Unicode normalization (en-dash, em-dash, curly quotes, non-breaking spaces)
  - Smart duplicate handling appends disambiguating numbers

### New Files
- `src/core/services/chapterNormalizer.ts` - Core normalization engine with pattern matchers
- `src/shared/hooks/useNormalizedChapters.ts` - React hook for chapter normalization
- `src/features/profile/stores/chapterCleaningStore.ts` - Settings store for cleaning preferences
- `src/features/profile/screens/ChapterCleaningSettingsScreen.tsx` - Settings UI with level selection

### Files Modified
- `src/features/book-detail/components/ChaptersTab.tsx` - Uses normalized chapter names
- `src/features/book-detail/components/ChapterList.tsx` - Uses normalized chapter names
- `src/features/profile/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Added link to Chapter Names settings

## [0.4.32] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **URL Auto-Correction (Issue 1.5)**: Login screen now automatically normalizes server URLs - adds `https://` if no protocol specified, removes trailing slashes, and validates URL format. Shows correction message when URL is auto-fixed.

- **Not Started & Completed Filters (Issues 2.10/2.11)**: My Library tab bar now includes "Not Started" and "Completed" filters. Not Started shows books with 0% progress, Completed shows books with ≥95% progress. Each tab has contextual empty states.

- **Chapter Skip via Long-Press (Issues 3.13/3.14)**: Long-press (400ms) on skip back/forward buttons jumps to previous/next chapter. Short tap still skips by configured seconds. Includes haptic feedback and larger disc spin animation for chapter jumps.

- **Offline State for Non-Downloaded Books (Issue 6.16)**: BookCard now shows visual offline state when the user is offline and the book isn't downloaded:
  - Cover at 40% opacity
  - Red badge with cloud-off icon
  - Download button disabled with cloud-off icon
  - Uses `useNetworkStatus()` hook for real-time detection

### Investigated
- **Android Auto (Issues 8.x)**: Native Android Auto modules (`AndroidAutoModule.kt`, `MediaPlaybackService.kt`) were deleted during app rename. TypeScript code is ready, but native Kotlin implementation needs to be recreated. Lock screen controls work via expo-media-control; Android Auto browsing requires native MediaBrowserService.

### Files Modified
- `src/features/auth/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - URL normalization and correction UI

---

## [0.4.31] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **Invalid Credentials Error (Issue 1.11)**: Login now shows user-friendly error messages instead of generic "Unauthorized" - displays "Invalid username or password" for auth failures, "Cannot connect to server" for network issues, and "Server error" for 500s.

- **Player Open Stutter (Issue 5.1)**: Fixed player animation re-triggering on every re-render by tracking previous visibility state with a ref. Animation now only runs on actual visibility transitions.

- **Download Cancel UI Clarity (Issue 6.6)**: Made the cancel button more visually prominent during active downloads with a red background and red icon, making it easier to distinguish from the pause/resume button.

- **App Open Transition Glitch (Issue 10.6)**: Wrapped all heavy initialization (audio service, player settings, queue init, network monitor, download manager) in `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions()` to defer until after animations complete.

### Improved
- **Live Sleep Timer Countdown (Issue 4.6)**: Sleep timer now displays live MM:SS countdown format (e.g., "12:45") instead of static minute approximations. Shows precise time remaining under 1 hour.

- **Network Status Indicator (Issues 10.13 & 10.16)**: Added global `NetworkStatusBar` component that slides down from top when offline. Uses NetInfo for real-time network monitoring with smooth spring animations. Also exports `useNetworkStatus()` hook for screens needing network state.

### Files Modified
- `src/core/auth/authService.ts` - User-friendly login error messages
- `src/features/player/screens/CDPlayerScreen.tsx` - Live sleep timer format, player animation fix

- **Playback Speed Restoration (Bug 4.20/4.21)**: Speed indicator now correctly shows the actual playback rate after app restart. Added persistence of active playback rate and last played book ID. On restore, the rate is applied to both the store (UI) and audioService to ensure sync.

- **Haptics Consistency (Bug 10.11/10.12)**: Updated skip buttons to use category-specific `haptics.skip()` method for proper category checking. Updated SleepTimerSheet to use `haptics.sleepTimerSet()` and `haptics.sleepTimerClear()`. Updated SpeedSheet to use `haptics.speedChange()`.

### Improved
- **Lock Screen Controls (Bug 7.5-7.10)**: Added better logging for media control metadata and playback state updates to help diagnose Android lock screen issues. Added `android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"` to MediaPlaybackService for Android 10+ compatibility.

### Files Modified
